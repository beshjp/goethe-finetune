I hold thee; my Dora,\nAnd thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.\n\nOft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,\nWhile thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.\n\nEager  and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,\nBoldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.\n\nThen was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,\nThen, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.\n\nOft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,\nYet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.\n\nThus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,\nAs on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,\n\nGlad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom\nNot the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.\n\nYears thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only\nTwenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.\n\nNow by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,\nBillow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.\n\nAll were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father\nRan at full speed and exclaim'd: \"Hasten thee quick to the strand\n\nHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,\nWhile the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;\n\nCome, Alexis, oh come!\"\u2014My worthy stout-hearted father\nPress'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,\n\nWhile my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,\n\"Happy mayst thou return!\" cried they\u2014\" both happy and rich!\"\n\nThen I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,\nRunning along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,\n\nAt the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then \"Alexis!\nSay, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?\n\nForeign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,\nOrnaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.\n\nBring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,\nOft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that.\"\n\nThere I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision\nAfter the form and the weight which thy commission should have.\n\nModest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing\nOn thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.\n\nLoudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest\n\"Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friend\n\nTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean\nBeareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land.\"\nSo I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,\nAnd the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.\n\nOft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling\nInto the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.\n\nPresently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,\nSweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.\n\nThen thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:\nFirst the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,\n\nThen the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,\nAnd with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.\n\nBut I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,\nAnd my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,\n\nSoon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining\nRound thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.\n\nOn my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,\nSoon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.\n\nAmor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,\nAnd, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tears\n\nStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,\nAnd, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.\n\nLouder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer\nBear my weight, and I cried:\u2014\"Dora! and art thou not mine?\"\n\n\"Thine forever!\" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding\nSeem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.\n\nNearer was heard the cry \"Alexis!\" The stripling who sought me\nSuddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!\n\nHow he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me\nHow the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.\n\nDrunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;\nAnd as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd.\n\n\"Thine for ever!\" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses\nWith the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throne\n\nStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing\nClose by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!\n\nOh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!\nOnward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!\n\nBring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith\nMay in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!\n\nAy, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!\nNine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'd\n\nOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,\nRichly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.\n\nThere shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely\nBe to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the gold\n\nHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.\nOh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!\n\nPearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me\nBrings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.\n\nI will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,\nJoyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.\n\nYet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;\nWith them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.\n\nFine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,\nFit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;\n\nCostly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest\nMe, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.\n\nVisions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,\nSoften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!\n\nYet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.\nWhen, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.\n\nNeither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking\nAwe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,\n\nAs by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one\nFar away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!\n\nAnd another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,\nAnd for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!\n\nDoth she entice him as well to the arbour? He follows? Oh, make me\nBlind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!\n\nYes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly\nYield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.\n\nSmile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!\nThunder more fearfully! Strike!\u2014Stay\u2014thy fierce lightnings withhold!\n\nHurl at me thy quivering bolt! In the darkness of midnight\nStrike with thy lightning this mast, make it a pitiful wreck!\n\nScatter the planks all around, and give to the boisterous billows\nAll these wares, and let me be to the dolphins a prey\n\nNow, ye Muses, enough! In vain would ye strive to depicture\nHow, in a love-laden breast, anguish alternates with bliss.\n\nYe cannot heal the wounds, it is true, that love hath inflicted;\nYet from you only proceeds, kindly ones, comfort and balm."}]}

EUTERPE.\nMOTHER AND SON.\nTHUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the mother"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "THUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the mother\n\nWent in search of her son,\u2014at first in front of the dwelling\n\nOn the bench of stone, for he was accustom'd to sit there.\n\nWhen she found him not there, she went to look in the stable,\n\nThinking perchance he was feeding his splendid horses, the stallions\n\nWhich he had bought when foals, and which he entrusted to no one.\n\nBut the servant inform'd her that he had gone to the garden.\n\nThen she nimbly strode across the long double courtyard,\n\nLeft the stables behind, and the barns all made of good timber,\n\nEnter'd the garden which stretch'd far away to the walls of the borough,\n\nWalk'd across it, rejoicing to see how all things were growing,\n\nCarefully straighten'd the props, on which the apple-tree's branches,\n\nHeavily loaded, reposed, and the weighty boughs of the pear-tree,\n\nTook a few caterpillars from off the strong-sprouting cabbage;\n\nFor a bustling woman is never idle one moment.\n\nIn this manner she came to the end of the long-reaching garden,\n\nWhere was the arbour all cover'd with woodbine: she found not her son there,\n\nNor was he to be seen in any part of the garden.\n\nBut she found on the latch the door which out of the arbour\n\nThrough the wall of the town had been made by special permission\n\nDuring their ancestor's time, the worthy old burgomaster.\n\nSo she easily stepp'd across the dry ditch at the spot where\n\nOn the highway abutted their well-inclosed excellent vineyard.\n\nRising steeply upwards, its face tow'rd the sun turn'd directly.\n\nUp the hill she proceeded, rejoicing, as farther she mounted,\n\nAt the size of the grapes, which scarcely were hid by the foliage.\n\nShady and well-cover'd in, the middle walk at the top was,\n\nWhich was ascended by steps of rough flat pieces constructed.\n\nAnd within it were hanging fine chasselas and muscatels also,\n\nAnd a reddish-blue grape, of quite an exceptional bigness,\n\nAll with carefulness planted, to give to their guests after dinner.\n\nBut with separate stems the rest of the vineyard was planted,\n\nSmaller grapes producing, from which the finest wine made is.\n\nSo she constantly mounted, enjoying in prospect the autumn.\n\nAnd the festal day, when the neighbourhood met with rejoicing,\n\nPicking and treading the grapes, and putting the must in the wine-vats,\n\nEvery corner and nook resounding at night with the fireworks,\n\nBlazing and cracking away, due honour to pay to the harvest.\n\nBut she uneasy became, when she in vain had been calling\n\nTwice and three times her son, and when the sole answer that reach'd her\n\nCame from the garrulous echo which out of the town towers issued.\n\nStrange it appear'd to have to seek him; he never went far off,\n\n(As he before had told her) in order to ward off all sorrow\n\nFrom his dear mother, and her forebodings of coming disaster.\n\nBut she still was expecting upon the highway to find him,\n\nFor the doors at the bottom, like those at the top, of the vineyard\n\nStood wide open; and so at length she enter'd the broad field\n\nWhich, with its spreading expanse, o'er the whole of the hill's back extended.\n\nOn their own property still she proceeded, greatly rejoicing\n\nAt their own crops, and at the corn which nodded so bravely,\n\nOver the whole field in golden majesty waving.\n\nThen on the border between the fields she follow'd the footpath,\n\nKeeping her eye on the pear-tree fix'd, the big one, which standing\n\nPerch'd by itself on the top of the hill, their property bounded.\n\nWho had planted it, no one knew; throughout the whole country\n\nFar and wide was it visible; noted also its fruit was.\n\nUnder its shadow the reaper ate his dinner at noonday,\n\nAnd the herdsman was wont to lie, when tending his cattle.\n\nBenches made of rough stones and of turf were placed all about it.\n\nAnd she was not mistaken; there sat her Hermann and rested\n\nOn his arm he was leaning, and seem'd to be looking cross country\n\nTow'rds the mountains beyond; his back was turn'd to his mother.\n\nSoftly creeping up, she lightly tapp'd on his shoulder;\n\nAnd he hastily turn'd; she saw that his eyes full of tears were.\n\"Mother,\" he said in confusion:\u2014\"You greatly surprise me!\" and quickly\n\nWiped he away his tears, the noble and sensitive youngster.\n\n\"What! You are weeping, my son?\" the startled mother continued\n\n\"That is indeed unlike you! I never before saw you crying!\n\nSay, what has sadden'd your heart? What drives you to sit here all lonely\n\nUnder the shade of the pear-tree? What is it that makes you unhappy?\"\nThen the excellent youth collected himself, and made answer\n\n\"Truly that man can have no heart, but a bosom of iron,\n\nWho no sympathy feels for the wants of unfortunate exiles;\n\nHe has no sense in his head who, in times of such deep tribulation,\n\nHas no concern for himself or for his country's well-being.\n\nWhat I to-day have seen and heard, has stirr'd up my feelings;\n\nWell, I have come up here, and seen the beautiful, spreading\n\nLandscape, which in fruitful hills to our sight is presented,\n\nSeen the golden fruit of the sheaves all nodding together,\n\nAnd a plentiful crop of fruit, full garners foreboding.\n\nBut, alas, how near is the foe! By the Rhine's flowing waters\n\nWe are protected indeed; but what are rivers and mountains\n\nTo such a terrible nation, which hurries along like a tempest!\n\nFor they summon together the young and the old from all quarters,\n\nRushing wildly along, while the multitude little is caring\n\nEven for death; when one falls, his place is straight fill'd by another,\n\nAh! and can Germans dare to remain at home in their dwellings,\n\nThinking perchance to escape from the widely-threat'ning disaster?\n\nDearest mother, I tell you that I to-day am quite sorry\n\nThat I was lately excused, when they selected the fighters\n\nOut of the townfolk. 'Tis true I'm an only son, and more-over\n\nLarge is our inn, and our business also is very important;\n\nWere it not better however for me to fight in the vanguard\n\nOn the frontier, than here to await disaster and bondage?\n\nYes, my spirit has told me, and in my innermost bosom\n\nFeel I courage and longing to live and die for my country,\n\nAnd to others to set an example worthy to follow.\n\nOh, of a truth, if the strength of the German youths was collected\n\nOn the frontier, all bound by a vow not to yield to the stranger,\n\nHe on our noble soil should never set foot, or be able\n\nUnder our eyes to consume the fruits of the land, or to issue\n\nOrders unto our men, or despoil our women and maidens!\n\nSee, good mother, within my inmost heart I've determined\n\nSoon and straightway to do what seems to me right and becoming;\n\nFor the man who thinks long, not always chooses what best is.\n\nSee, I will not return to the house, but will go from here straightway\n\nInto the town, and there will place at the fighters' disposal\n\nThis stout arm and this heart, to serve, as I best can, my country.\n\nThen let my father say whether feelings of honour are stirring\n\nIn my bosom or not, and whether I yearn to mount upwards.\"\nThen with significance answer'd his good and sensible mother,\n\nShedding tears in silence, which easily rose in her eyelids:\u2014\n\n\"Son, what has wrought so strange a change in your temper and feelings,\n\nThat you freely and openly speak to your mother no longer,\n\nAs you till yesterday did, nor tell her truly your wishes?\n\nIf another had heard you speaking, he doubtless would praise you\n\nHighly, and deem your new resolution as worthy of honour,\n\nBeing deceived by your words, and by your manner of speaking.\n\nI however can only blame you. I know you much better.\n\nYou are concealing your heart, and very diff'rent your thoughts are;\n\nFor I am sure you care not at all for drum and for trumpet,\n\nNor, to please the maidens, care you to wear regimentals.\n\nFor, though brave you may be, and gallant, your proper vocation\n\nIs to remain at home, the property quietly watching.\n\nTherefore tell me truly: What means this sudden decision?\"\nEarnestly answer'd the son:\u2014\"You are wrong, dear-mother, one day is\n\nUnlike another. The youth soon ripens into his manhood.\n\nOfttimes he ripens better to action in silence than living\n\nThat tumultuous noisy life which ruins so many.\n\nAnd though silent I have been, and am, a heart has been fashion'd\n\nInside my bosom, which hates whatever unfair and unjust is,\n\nAnd I am able right well to discriminate secular matters.\n\nWork moreover my arms and my feet has mightily strengthen'd.\n\nAll that I tell you is true; I boldly venture to say so.\n\nAnd yet, mother, you blame me with reason; you've caught me employing\n\nWords that are only half true, and that serve to conceal my true feelings.\n\nFor I must need confess, it is not the advent of danger\n\nCalls me away from my father's house, nor a resolute purpose\n\nUseful to be to my country, and dreaded to be by the foeman.\n\nWords alone it was that I utter'd,\u2014words only intended\n\nThose deep feelings to hide, which within my breast are contending.\n\nAnd now leave me, my mother! For as in my bosom I cherish\n\nWishes that are but vain, my life will be to no purpose.\n\nFor I know that the Unit who makes a self-sacrifice, only\n\nInjures himself, unless all endeavour the Whole to accomplish.\"\n\"Now continue,\" replied forthwith his sensible mother:\u2014\n\n\"Tell me all that has happen'd, the least as w'ell as the greatest\n\nMen are always hasty, and only remember the last thing,\n\nAnd the hasty are easily forced from the road by obstructions.\n\nBut a woman is skillful, and full of resources, and scorns not\n\nBye-roads to traverse when needed, well-skill'd to accomplish her purpose.\n\nTell me then all, and why you are stirr'd by such violent feelings\n\nMore than I ever have seen, while the blood is boiling within you,\n\nAnd from your eyes the tears against your will fain would fall now.\"\nThen the youth gave way to his sorrow, and burst into weeping,\n\nWeeping aloud on the breast of his mother, and softly replying\n\n\"Truly, my father's words to-day have wounded me sadly,\n\nNever have I deserved at his hands such treatment,\u2014no, never!\n\nFor to honour my parents was always my wish from my childhood,\n\nNo one ever appear'd so prudent and wise as my parents,\n\nWho in the darker days of childhood carefully watch'd me.\n\nMuch indeed it has been my lot to endure from my playmates,\n\nWhen with their knavish pranks they used to embitter my temper.\n\nOften I little suspected the tricks they were playing upon me:\n\nBut if they happen'd to ridicule Father, whenever on Sundays\n\nOut of church he came with his slow deliberate footsteps,\n\nIf they laugh'd at the strings of his cap, and his dressing-gown's flowers,\n\nWhich he in stately wise wore, and to-day at length has discarded,\n\nThen in a fury I clench'd my fist, and, storming and raging,\n\nFell upon them and hit and struck with terrible onslaught,\n\nHeedless where my blows fell. With bleeding noses they halloed,\n\nAnd could scarcely escape from the force of my blows and my kicking.\n\nThen, as in years I advanced, I had much to endure from my father,\n\nWho, in default of others to blame, would often abuse me,\n\nWhen at the Council's last sitting his anger perchance was excited,\n\nAnd I the penalty paid of the squabbles and strife of his colleagues.\n\nYou yourself have oft pitied me; I endured it with patience,\n\nAlways rememb'ring the much-to-be-honour'd kindness of parents,\n\nWhose only thought is to swell for our sakes their goods and possessions,\n\nAnd who deprive themselves of much, to save for their children.\n\nBut, alas, not saving alone, for enjoyment hereafter,\n\nConstitutes happiness, no, not heaps of gold or of silver,\n\nNeither field upon field, however compact the estate be.\n\nFor the father grows old, and his son at the same time grows older,\n\nFeeling no joy in To-day, and full of care for To-morrow.\n\nNow look down from this height, and see how beauteous before us\n\nLies the fair rich expanse, with vineyard and gardens at bottom;\n\nThere are the stables and barns, and the rest of the property likewise;\n\nThere I also descry the back of our house, in the gables\n\nOf the roof may be seen the window of my small apartment.\n\nWhen I remember the time when I used to look out for the moon there\n\nHalf through the night, or perchance at morning awaited the sunrise,\n\nWhen with but few hours of healthy sleep I was fully contented,\n\nAh, how lonely do all things appear! My chamber, the court, and\n\nGarden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside;\n\nAll appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!\"\n\nThen his good mother answer'd his speech in a sensible manner\n\n\"Son, your wish to be able to lead your bride to her chamber,\n\nTurning the night to the dearest and happiest half of your lifetime,\n\nMaking your work by day more truly free and unfetter'd,\n\nCannot be greater than that of your father and mother. We always\n\nUrged you,\u2014commanded, I even might say,\u2014to choose some fair maiden.\n\nBut I know full well, and my heart has told me already\n\nIf the right hour arrives not, or if the right maiden appears not\n\nInstantly when they are sought for, man's choice is thrown in confusion,\n\nAnd he is driven by fear to seize what is counterfeit only.\n\nIf I may tell you, my son, your choice already is taken,\n\nFor your heart is smitten, and sensitive more than is usual.\n\nAnswer me plainly, then, for my spirit already has told me:\n\nShe whom now you have chosen is that poor emigrant maiden!\"\n\"Yes, dear mother, you're right!\" the son with vivacity answer'd\n\nYes, it is she! And unless this very day I conduct her\n\nHome as my bride, she will go on her way and escape me for ever,\n\nIn the confusion of war, and in moving backwards and forwards.\n\nMother, then before my eyes will in vain he unfolded\n\nAll our rich estate, and each year henceforward be fruitful.\n\nYes, the familiar house and the garden will be my aversion.\n\nAh, and the love of my mother no comfort will give to my sorrow,\n\nFor I feel that by Love each former bond must be loosen'd,\n\nWhen her own bonds she knits; 'tis not the maiden alone who\n\nLeaves her father and mother behind, when she follows her husband.\n\nSo it is with the youth; no more he knows mother and father.\n\nWhen he beholds the maiden, the only beloved one, approaching.\n\nTherefore let me go hence, to where desperation may lead me,\n\nFor my father already has spoken in words of decision,\n\nAnd his house no longer is mine, if he shuts out the maiden\n\nWhom alone I would fain take home as my bride from henceforward.\"\nThen the excellent sensible mother answer'd with quickness\n\n\"Men are precisely like rocks when they stand opposed to each other!\n\nProud and unyielding, the one will never draw near to the other.\n\nNeither will suffer his tongue to utter the first friendly accent.\n\nTherefore I tell you, my son, a hope still exists in my bosom,\n\nIf she is worthy and good, he will give his consent to your marriage,\n\nPoor though she be, and although with disdain he refused you the poor thing.\n\nFor in his hot-beaded fashion he utters many expressions\n\nWhich he never intends; and so will accept the Refused One.\n\nBut he requires kind words, and has a right to require them,\n\nFor your father he is; his anger is all after dinner,\n\nWhen he more eagerly speaks, and questions the reasons of others,\n\nMeaning but little thereby; the wine then excites all the vigour\n\nOf his impetuous will, and prevents him from giving due weight to\n\nOther people's opinions; he hears and he feels his own only.\n\nBut when evening arrives, the tone of the many discourses\n\nWhich his friends and himself hold together, is very much alter'd.\n\nMilder becomes he, as soon as his liquor's effects have passed over\n\nAnd he feels the injustice his eagerness did unto others.\n\nCome, we will venture at once! Success the reward is of boldness,\n\nAnd we have need of the friends who now have assembled around him.\u2014\n\nMost of all we shall want the help of our excellent pastor.\"\n\nThus she eagerly spoke, and leaving the stone that she sat on,\n\nAlso lifted her son from his seat. He willingly follow'd,\n\nAnd they descended in silence, revolving the weighty proposal."}]}

afar remain!\nRapture now can never smile on me;\n\nFor the fatal step, alas! is ta'en,\nThrough my mother's sick-bed phantasy.\nCured, she made this oath:\n'Youth and nature both\nShall henceforth to Heav'n devoted be.'\n\"From the house, so silent now, are driven\nAll the gods who reign'd supreme of yore;\n\nOne Invisible now rules in heaven,\nOn the cross a Saviour they adore.\nVictims slay they here,\nNeither lamb nor steer,\n\nBut the altars reek with human gore.\"\nAnd he lists, and ev'ry word he weighs,\nWhile his eager soul drinks in each sound:\n\n\"Can it be that now before my gaze\nStands my loved one on this silent ground?\nPledge to me thy troth!\nThrough our father's oath:\nWith Heav'ns blessing will our love be crown'd.\"\n\"Kindly youth, I never can be thine!\n'Tis my sister they intend for thee.\n\nWhen I in the silent cloister pine,\nAh, within her arms remember me!\nThee alone I love,\nWhile love's pangs I prove;\nSoon the earth will veil my misery.\"\n\"No! for by this glowing flame I swear,\nHymen hath himself propitious shown:\n\nLet us to my fathers house repair,\nAnd thoult find that joy is not yet flown,\nSweetest, here then stay,\nAnd without delay\nHold we now our wedding feast alone!\"\nThen exchange they tokens of their truth;\nShe gives him a golden chain to wear,\n\nAnd a silver chalice would the youth\nGive her in return of beauty rare.\n\"That is not for me;\nYet I beg of thee,\n\nOne lock only give me of thy hair.\"\nNow the ghostly hour of midnight knell'd,\nAnd she seem'd right joyous at the sign;\n\nTo her pallid lips the cup she held,\nBut she drank of nought but blood-red wine.\nFor to taste the bread\nThere before them spread,\nNought he spoke could make the maid incline.\nTo the youth the goblet then she brought,\u2014\nHe too quaff'd with eager joy the bowl.\n\nLove to crown the silent feast he sought,\nAh! full love-sick was the stripling's soul.\nFrom his prayer she shrinks,\nTill at length he sinks\nOn the bed and weeps without control.\nAnd she comes, and lays her near the boy:\n\"How I grieve to see thee sorrowing so!\n\nIf thou think'st to clasp my form with joy,\nThou must learn this secret sad to know;\nYes! the maid, whom thou\nCall'st thy loved one now,\nIs as cold as ice, though white as snow.\"\nThen he clasps her madly in his arm,\nWhile love's youthful might pervades his frame:\n\n\"Thou might'st hope, when with me, to grow warm,\nE'en if from the grave thy spirit came!\nBreath for breath, and kiss!\nOverflow of bliss!\nDost not thou, like me, feel passion's flame?\"\nLove still closer rivets now their lips,\nTears they mingle with their rapture blest,\n\nFrom his mouth the flame she wildly sips,\nEach is with the other's thought possess'd.\nHis hot ardour's flood\nWarms her chilly blood,\nBut no heart is beating in her breast.\nIn her care to see that nought went wrong,\nNow the mother happen'd to draw near;\n\nAt the door long hearkens she, full long,\nWond'ring at the sounds that greet her ear.\nTones of joy and sadness,\nAnd love's blissful madness,\nAs of bride and bridegroom they appear,\nFrom the door she will not now remove\n'Till she gains full certainty of this;\n\nAnd with anger hears she vows of love,\nSoft caressing words of mutual bliss.\n\"Hush! the cock's loud strain!\nBut thoult come again,\nWhen the night returns!\"\u2014then kiss on kiss.\nThen her wrath the mother cannot hold,\nBut unfastens straight the lock with ease\n\n\"In this house are girls become so bold,\nAs to seek e'en strangers' lusts to please?\"\nBy her lamp's clear glow\nLooks she in,\u2014and oh!\nSight of horror!\u2014'tis her child she sees.\nFain the youth would, in his first alarm,\nWith the veil that o'er her had been spread,\n\nWith the carpet, shield his love from harm;\nBut she casts them from her, void of dread,\nAnd with spirit's strength,\nIn its spectre length,\nLifts her figure slowly from the bed.\n\"Mother! mother!\"\u2014Thus her wan lips say:\n\"May not I one night of rapture share?\n\nFrom the warm couch am I chased away?\nDo I waken only to despair?\nIt contents not thee\nTo have driven me\nAn untimely shroud of death to wear?\n\"But from out my coffin's prison-bounds\nBy a wond'rous fate I'm forced to rove,\n\nWhile the blessings and the chaunting sounds\nThat your priests delight in, useless prove.\nWater, salt, are vain\nFervent youth to chain,\nAh, e'en Earth can never cool down love!\n\"When that infant vow of love was spoken,\nVenus' radiant temple smiled on both.\n\nMother! thou that promise since hast broken,\nFetter'd by a strange, deceitful oath.\nGods, though, hearken ne'er,\nShould a mother swear\nTo deny her daughter's plighted troth.\nFrom my grave to wander I am forc'd,\nStill to seek The Good's long-sever'd link,\n\nStill to love the bridegroom I have lost,\nAnd the life-blood of his heart to drink;\nWhen his race is run,\nI must hasten on,\nAnd the young must 'neath my vengeance sink,\n\"Beauteous youth! no longer mayst thou live;\nHere must shrivel up thy form so fair;\n\nDid not I to thee a token give,\nTaking in return this lock of hair?\nView it to thy sorrow!\nGrey thoult be to-morrow,\nOnly to grow brown again when there.\n\"Mother, to this final prayer give ear!\nLet a funeral pile be straightway dress'd;\n\nOpen then my cell so sad and drear,\nThat the flames may give the lovers rest!\nWhen ascends the fire\nFrom the glowing pyre,\nTo the gods of old we'll hasten, blest.\""}]}
