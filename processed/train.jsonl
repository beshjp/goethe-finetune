TERPSICHORE.\nHERMANN.\nTHEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "HERMANN.\nTHEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,\n\nStraightway with piercing glances the minister eyed him intently,\n\nAnd with carefulness watch'd his looks and the whole of his bearing,\n\nWith an inquiring eye which easily faces decyphers;\n\nThen he smiled, and with cordial words address'd him as follows\n\n\"How you are changed in appearance, my friend! I never have seen you\n\nHalf so lively before; your looks are thoroughly cheerful.\n\nYou have return'd quite joyous and merry. You've doubtless divided\n\nAll of the presents amongst the poor, their blessings receiving.\"\nThen in calm accents replied the son, with gravity speaking\n\n\"Whether I've laudably acted, I know not; I follow'd the impulse\n\nOf my own heart, as now I'll proceed to describe with exactness.\n\nMother, you rummaged so long, in looking over old pieces,\n\nAnd in making your choice, that 'twas late when the bundle was ready,\n\nAnd the wine and the beer were slowly and carefully pack'd up.\n\nWhen I at length emerged at the gate, and came on the highway,\n\nStreams of citizens met I returning, with women and children,\n\nFor the train of the exiles had long disappear'd in the distance.\n\nSo I quicken'd my pace, and hastily drove to the village\n\nWhere I had heard that to-night to rest and to sleep they intended.\n\nWell, as I went on my way, the newly-made causeway ascending,\n\nSuddenly saw I a waggon, of excellent timber constructed,\n\nDrawn by a couple of oxen, the best and the strongest of foreign.\n\nClose beside it there walk'd, with sturdy footsteps, a maiden,\n\nGuiding the two strong beasts with a long kind of staff, which with skill she\n\nKnew how to use, now driving, and now restraining their progress.\n\nWhen the maiden observed me, she quietly came near the horses,\n\nAnd address'd me as follows:\u2014'Our usual condition, believe me,\n\nIs not so sad as perchance you might judge from our present appearance.\n\nI am not yet accustom'd to ask for alms from a stranger,\n\nWho so often but gives, to rid himself of a beggar.\n\nBut I'm compell'd to speak by necessity. Here on the straw now\n\nLies the lately-confined poor wife of a wealthy landowner,\n\nWhom with much trouble I managed to save with oxen and waggon.\n\nWe were late in arriving, and scarcely with life she escaped.\n\nNow the newly-born child in her arms is lying, all naked,\n\nAnd our friends will be able to give them but little assistance,\n\nE'en if in the next village, to which to-night we are going,\n\nWe should still find them, although I fear they have left it already.\n\nIf you belong to the neighbourhood, any available linen\n\nThese poor people will deem a most acceptable present.\n\"Thus she spake, and wearily raised herself the pale patient\n\nUp from the straw and gazed upon me, while thus I made answer\n\n'Oft doth a heavenly spirit whisper to kind-hearted people,\n\nSo that they feel the distress o'er their poorer brethren impending;\n\nFor my mother, your troubles foreboding, gave me a bundle\n\nReady prepared for relieving the wants of those who were naked.'\n\nThen I loosen'd the knots of the cord, and the dressing-gown gave her\n\nWhich belong'd to my father, and gave her some shirts and some linen,\n\nAnd she thank'd me with joy and said:\u2014'The fortunate know not\n\nHow 'tis that miracles happen; we only discover in sorrow\n\nGod's protecting finger and hand, extended to beckon\n\nGood men to good. May your kindness to us by Him be requited.'\n\nAnd I saw the poor patient joyfully handling the linen,\n\nValuing most of all the soft flannel, the dressing-gown lining.\n\nThen the maid thus address'd her:\u2014'Now let us haste to the village\n\nWhere our friends are resting, to-night intending to sleep there\n\nThere I will straightway attend to what e'er for the infant is needed.'\n\nThen she saluted me too, her thanks most heartily giving,\n\nDrove the oxen, the waggon went on. I lingerd behind them,\n\nHolding my horses rein'd back, divided between two opinions,\n\nWhether to hasten ahead, reach the village, the viands distribute\n\n'Mongst the rest of the people, or give them forthwith to the maiden,\n\nSo that she might herself divide them amongst them with prudence\n\nSoon I made up my mind, and follow'd after her softly,\n\nOvertook her without delay, and said to her quickly\n\n'Maiden, it was not linen alone that my mother provided\n\nAnd in the carriage placed, as clothing to give to the naked,\n\nBut she added meat, and many an excellent drink too;\n\nAnd I have got quite a stock stow'd away in the boot of the carriage.\n\nWell, I have taken a fancy the rest of the gifts to deposit\n\nIn your hands, and thus fulfil to the best my commission;\n\nYou will divide them with prudence, whilst I my fate am obeying.'\n\nThen the maiden replied:\u2014'With faithfulness I will distribute\n\nAll your gifts, and the needy shall surely rejoice at your bounty.'\n\nThus she spake, and I hastily open'd the boot of the carriage,\n\nTook out the hams (full heavy they were) and took out the bread-stuffs,\n\nFlasks of wine and beer, and handed the whole of them over.\n\nGladly would I have given her more, but empty the boot was.\n\nStraightway she pack'd them away at the feet of the patient, and forthwith\n\nStarted again, whilst I hasten'd back to the town with my horses.\"\nThen when Hermann had ended his story, the garrulous neighbour\n\nOpen'd his mouth and exclaim'd:\u2014\"I only deem the man happy\n\nWho lives alone in his house in these days of flight and confusion,\n\nWho has neither wife nor children cringing beside him\n\nI feel happy at present; I hate the title of father;\n\nCare of children and wife in these days would be a sad drawback.\n\nOften have I bethought me of flight, and have gather'd together\n\nAll that I deem most precious, the antique gold and the jewels\n\nWorn by my late dear mother, not one of which has been sold yet.\n\nMuch indeed is left out, that is not so easily carried.\n\nEven the herbs and the roots, collected with plenty of trouble,\n\nI should he sorry to lose, though little in value they may be.\n\nIf the dispenser remains, I shall leave my house in good spirits\n\nIf my ready money is saved, and my body, why truly\n\nAll is saved, for a bachelor easily flies when 'tis needed.\"\n\"Neighbour,\" rejoin'd forthwith young Hermann, with emphasis speaking\n\n\"Altogether I differ, and greatly blame your opinions.\n\nCan that man be deem'd worthy, who both in good and ill fortune\n\nThinks alone of himself, and knows not the secret of sharing\n\nSorrows and joys with others, and feels no longing to do so?\n\nI could more easily now than before determine to marry\n\nMany an excellent maiden needs a husband's protection,\n\nMany a man a cheerful wife, when sorrow's before him.\"\n\nSmilingly said then the father:\u2014\"I'm pleas'd to hear what you're saying,\n\nWords of such wisdom have seldom been utter'd by you in my presence.\nThen his good mother broke in, in her turn, with vivacity speaking\n\n\"Son, you are certainly right. We parents set the example.\n\n'Twas not in time of pleasure that we made choice of each other,\n\nAnd 'twas the saddest of hours, that knitted us closely together.\n\nMonday morning,\u2014how well I remember! the very day after\n\nThat most terrible fire occurr'd which burnt down the borough,\n\nTwenty years ago now; the day, like to-day, was a Sunday,\n\nHot and dry was the weather, and little available water.\n\nAll the inhabitants, clothed in their festival garments, were walking,\n\nScatter'd about in the inns and the mills of the neighbouring hamlets.\n\nAt one end of the town the fire broke out, and the flames ran\n\nHastily all through the streets, impell'd by the draught they created.\n\nAnd the barns were consumed, where all the rich harvest was gather'd\n\nAnd all the streets as far as the market; the dwelling house also\n\nOf my father hard by was destroy'd, as likewise was this one.\n\nLittle indeed could we save; I sat the sorrowful night through\n\nOn the green of the town, protecting the beds and the boxes.\n\nFinally sleep overtook me, and when by the cool breeze of morning\n\nWhich dies away when the sun arises I was awaken'd,\n\nSaw I the smoke and the glow, and the half-consumed walls and the chimneys.\n\nThen my heart was sorely afflicted; but soon in his glory\n\nRose the sun more brilliant than ever, my spirits reviving.\n\nThen in haste I arose, impell'd the site to revisit\n\nWhere our dwelling had stood, to see if the chickens were living\n\nWhich I especially loved; for childlike I still was by nature.\n\nBut when over the ruins of courtyard and house I was climbing,\n\nWhich still smoked, and saw my dwelling destroy'd and deserted,\n\nYou came up on the other side, the ruins exploring.\n\nYou had a horse shut up in his stall; the still-glowing rafters\n\nOver it lay, and rubbish, and nought could be seen of the creature.\n\nOver against each other we stood, in doubt and in sorrow,\n\nFor the wall had fallen which used to sever our courtyards;\n\nAnd you grasp'd my hand, addressing me softly as follows\n\n'Lizzy, what here are you doing? Away! Your soles you are burning,\n\nFor the rubbish is hot, and is scorching my boots which are thicker.'\n\nThen you lifted me up, and carried me off through your courtyard.\n\nThere still stood the gateway before the house, with its arch'd roof,\n\nJust as it now is standing, the only thing left remaining.\n\nAnd you sat me down and kiss'd me, and I tried to stop you,\n\nBut you presently said, with kindly words full of meaning\n\n'See, my house is destroy'd! Stop here and help me to build it,\n\nI in return will help to rebuild the house of your father.'\n\nI understood you not, till you sent to my father your mother,\n\nAnd ere long our marriage fulfilid the troth we soon plighted.\n\nStill to this day I remember with pleasure the half-consumed rafters,\n\nStill do I see the sun in all his majesty rising,\n\nFor on that day I gain'd my husband; the son of my youth too\n\nGained I during that earliest time of the wild desolation.\n\nTherefore commend I you, Hermann, for having with confidence guileless\n\nTurn'd towards marriage your thoughts in such a period of mourning,\n\nAnd for daring to woo in war and over the ruins.\u2014\"\nThen the father straightway replied, with eagerness speaking:\u2014\n\n\"Sensible is your opinion, and true is also the story\n\nWhich you have told us, good mother, for so did ev'rything happen.\n\nBut what is better is better. 'Tis not the fortune of all men\n\nAll their life and existence to find decided beforehand;\n\nAll are not doom'd to such troubles as we and others have suffer'd.\n\nO, how happy is he whose careful father and mother\n\nHave a house ready to give him, which he can successfully manage!\n\nAll beginnings are hard, and most so the landlords profession.\n\nNumberless things a man must have, and ev'rything daily\n\nDearer becomes, so he needs to scrape together more money.\n\nSo I am hoping that you, dear Hermann, will shortly be bringing\n\nHome to us a bride possessing an excellent dowry,\n\nFor a worthy husband deserves a girl who is wealthy,\n\nAnd 'tis a capital thing for the wish'd-for wife to bring with her\n\nPlenty of suitable articles stow'd in her baskets and boxes.\n\nNot in vain for years does the mother prepare for her daughter\n\nStocks of all kinds of linen, both finest and strongest in texture;\n\nNot in vain do god-parents give them presents of silver,\n\nOr the father lay by in his desk a few pieces of money.\n\nFor she hereafter will gladden, with all her goods and possessions,\n\nThat happy youth who is destined from out of all others to choose her.\n\nYes! I know how pleasant it makes a house for a young wife,\n\nWhen she finds her own property placed in the rooms and the kitchen,\n\nAnd when she herself has cover'd the bed and the table.\n\nOnly well-to-do brides should be seen in a house, I consider,\n\nFor a poor one is sure at last to be scorn'd by her husband,\n\nAnd he'll deem her a jade who as jade first appear'd with her bundle.\n\nMen are always unjust, but moments of love are but transient.\n\nYes, my Hermann, you greatly would cheer the old age of your father\n\nIf you soon would bring home a daughter-in-law to console me,\n\nOut of the neighbourhood too,\u2014yes, out of yon dwelling, the green one!\n\nRich is the man, in truth his trade and his manufactures\n\nMake him daily richer, for when does a merchant not prosper?\n\nHe has only three daughters; the whole of his wealth they'll inherit.\n\nTrue the eldest's already engaged; but then there's the second,\n\nAnd the third, who still (not for long) may be had for the asking.\n\nHad I been in your place, I should not till this time have waited;\n\nBring home one of the girls, as I brought your mother before you.\nThen, with modesty, answer'd the son his impetuous father\n\n\"Truly my wish was, like yours, to marry one of the daughters\n\nOf our neighbour. We all, in fact, were brought up together,\n\nSported in youthful days near the fountain adjoining the market,\n\nAnd from the rudeness of boys I often managed to save them.\n\nBut those days have long pass'd the maidens grew up, and with reason\n\nStop now at home and avoid the rougher pastimes of childhood.\n\nWell brought up with a vengeance they are! To please you, I sometimes\n\nWent to visit them, just for the sake of olden acquaintance\n\nBut I was never much pleased at holding intercourse with them,\n\nFor they were always finding fault, and I had to bear it\n\nFirst my coat was too long, the cloth too coarse, and the colour\n\nFar too common, my hair was cut and curl'd very badly.\n\nI at last was thinking of dressing myself like the shop-boys,\n\nWho are accustom'd on Sundays to show off their persons up yonder,\n\nAnd round whose coats in summer half-silken tatters are hanging.\n\nBut ere long I discover'd they only intended to fool me\n\nThis was very annoying, my pride was offended, but more still\n\nFelt I deeply wounded that they so mistook the good feelings\n\nWhich I cherish'd towards them, especially Minnie, the youngest.\n\nWell, I went last Easter, politely to pay them a visit,\n\nAnd I wore the new coat now hanging up in the closet,\n\nAnd was frizzled and curld, like all the rest of the youngsters.\n\nWhen I enter'd, they titter'd; but that didn't very much matter.\n\nMinnie sat at the piano, the father was present amongst them,\n\nPleased with his daughter's singing, and quite in a jocular humour.\n\nLittle could I understand of the words in the song she was singing,\n\nBut I constantly heard of Pamina, and then of Tamino,\n\n\nAnd I fain would express my opinion; so when she had ended,\n\nI ask'd questions respecting the text, and who were the persons.\n\nAll were silent and smiled; but presently answer'd the father\n\n'Did you e'er happen, my friend, to hear of Eve or of Adam?'\n\nThen no longer restrain'd they themselves, the girls burst out laughing,\n\nAll the boys laugh'd loudly, the old man's sides appear'd splitting.\n\nIn my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ring\n\nLasted all the time the singing and playing continued.\n\nThen I hasten'd home, ashamed and full of vexation,\n\nHung up my coat in the closet, and put my hair in disorder\n\nWith my fingers, and swore ne'er again to cross o'er their threshold.\n\nAnd I'm sure I was right; for they are all vain and unloving.\n\nAnd I hear they're so rude as to give me the nickname Tamino.\"\n\nThen the mother rejoin'd:\u2014\"You're wrong, dear Hermann, to harbour\n\nAngry feelings against the children, for they are but children.\n\nMinnie's an excellent girl, and has a tenderness for you;\n\nLately she ask'd how you were. Indeed, I wish you would choose her!\"\nThen the son thoughtfully answer'd:\u2014\"I know not why, but the fact is\n\nMy annoyance has graven itself in my mind, and hereafter\n\nI could not bear at the piano to see her, or list to her singing.\"\nBut the father sprang up, and said, in words full of anger\n\n\"Little comfort you give me, in truth! I always have said it,\n\nWhen you took pleasure in horses, and cared for nothing but fieldwork;\n\nThat which the servants of prosperous people perform as their duty,\n\nYou yourself do; meanwhile the father his son must dispense with,\n\nWho in his honour was wont to court the rest of the townsfolk.\n\nThus with empty hopes your mother early deceived me,\n\nWhen your reading, and writing, and learning at school ne'er succeeded\n\nLike the rest of the boys, and so you were always the lowest.\n\nThis all comes from a youth not possessing a due sense of honour,\n\nAnd not having the spirit to try and raise his position.\n\nHad my father but cared for me, as I have for you, sir,\n\nSent me to school betimes, and given me proper instructors,\n\nI should not merely have been the host of the famed Golden Lion.\"\nBut the son arose, and approach'd the doorway in silence,\n\nSlowly, and making no noise: but then the father in dudgeon\n\nAfter him shouted:\u2014\"Be off! I know you're an obstinate fellow!\n\nGo and look after the business; else I shall scold you severely;\n\nBut don't fancy I'll ever allow you to bring home in triumph\n\nAs my daughter-in-law any boorish impudent hussy.\n\nLong have I lived in the world, and know how to manage most people,\n\nKnow how to entertain ladies and gentlemen, so that they leave me\n\nIn good humour, and know how to flatter a stranger discreetly.\n\nBut my daughter-in-law must have useful qualities also,\n\nAnd be able to soften my manifold cares and vexations.\n\nShe must also play on the piano, that all the best people\n\nHere in the town may take pleasure in often coming to see us,\n\nAs in the house of our neighbour the merchant happens each Sunday.\"\n\nSoftly the son at these words raised the latch, and left the apartment."}]}

There begins, then, a biting,\n\nA picking, a pecking, a sipping,\n\nAnd each o'er the legs of another is tripping,\n\nAnd pushing, and pressing, and flapping,\n\nAnd chasing, and fuming, and snapping,\n\nAnd all for one small piece of bread,\n\nTo which, though dry, her fair hands give a taste,\n\nAs though it in ambrosia had been plac'd.\nAnd then her look! the tone\nWith which she calls: Pipi! Pipi!\n\nWould draw Jove's eagle from his throne;\n\nYes, Venus' turtle doves, I wean,\n\nAnd the vain peacock e'en,\n\nWould come, I swear,\n\nSoon as that tone had reach'd them through the air.\nE'en from a forest dark had she\nEnticed a bear, unlick'd, ill-bred,\nAnd, by her wiles alluring, led\n\nTo join the gentle company,\n\nUntil as tame as they was he:\n\n(Up to a certain point, be't understood!)\n\nHow fair, and, ah, how good\n\nShe seem'd to be! I would have drain'd my blood\n\nTo water e'en her flow'rets sweet.\n\"Thou sayest: I! Who? How?

Strength is left me still."}]}

ELEGY.\nWhen man had ceased to utter his lament,\nA god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.\nWHAT hope of once more meeting is there now\n\nIn the still-closed blossoms of this day?\n\nBoth heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;\n\nWhat wav'ring thoughts within the bosom play\n\nNo longer doubt! Descending from the sky,\n\nShe lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.\nAnd thus thou into Paradise wert brought,\nAs worthy of a pure and endless life;\n\nNothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,\nHere was the boundary of thine inmost strife:\n\nAnd seeing one so fair, so glorified,\n\nThe fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.\nNo motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,\nIn their own front the minutes seem'd to go;\n\nThe evening kiss, a true and binding seal,\nNe'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.\n\nThe hours resembled sisters as they went.\n\nYet each one from another different.\nThe last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd\nA beauteous network of entwining love.\n\nNow on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.\nAs though a flaming cherub bade them move;\n\nThe unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,\n\nBackward it looks, but closed it sees the door.\nAnd now within itself is closed this breast,\nAs though it ne'er were open, and as though,\n\nVying with ev'ry star, no moments blest\nHad, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;\n\nSadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,\n\nHang heavy on it in the sultry air.\nIs not the world still left? The rocky steeps,\nAre they with holy shades no longer crown'd?\n\nGrows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps\nThe espalier by the stream,\u2014the copse around?\n\nDoth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,\n\nNow rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?\nAs, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,\nWith softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,\n\nResembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,\nA slender figure hovers in the air,\u2014\n\nThus didst thou see her joyously advance,\n\nThe fairest of the fairest in the dance.\nYet but a moment dost thou boldly dare\nTo clasp an airy form instead of hers;\n\nBack to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,\nFor there in changeful guise her image stirs\n\nWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,\n\nIn thousand forms, each dearer than the last.\nAs at the door, on meeting lingerd she,\nAnd step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,\n\nFor the last kiss herself entreated me,\nAnd on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,\u2014\n\nThus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,\n\nWith flames engraven on a heart so true,\u2014\nA heart that, firm as some embattled tower,\nItself for her, her in itself reveres,\n\nFor her rejoices in its lasting power,\nConscious alone, when she herself appears;\n\nFeels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,\n\nAnd only beats to give her thanks in all.\nThe power of loving, and all yearning sighs\nFor love responsive were effaced and drown'd;\n\nWhile longing hope for joyous enterprise\nWas form'd, and rapid action straightway found;\n\nIf love can e'er a loving one inspire,\n\nMost lovingly it gave me now its fire;\nAnd 'twas through her!\u2014an inward sorrow lay\nOn soul and body, heavily oppress'd;\n\nTo mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,\nIn the drear void of a sad tortured breast;\n\nNow on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,\n\nHerself appeareth in the sunlight mild.\nUnto the peace of God, which, as we read,\nBlesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,\n\nLove's happy peace would I compare indeed,\nWhen in the presence of the dearest one.\n\nThere rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,\n\nThe thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.\nIn the pure bosom doth a yearning float,\nUnto a holier, purer, unknown Being\n\nIts grateful aspiration to devote,\nThe Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;\n\nWe call it: piety!\u2014such blest delight\n\nI feel a share in, when before her sight.\nBefore her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,\nBefore her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,\n\nIn its deep wintry cavern melts away\nSelf-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;\n\nNo selfishness and no self-will are nigh,\n\nFor at her advent they were forced to fly.\nIt seems as though she said: \"As hours pass by\nThey spread before us life with kindly plan;\n\nSmall knowledge did the yesterday supply,\nTo know the morrow is conceal'd from man;\n\nAnd if the thought of evening made me start,\n\nThe sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.\n\"Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,\nThe moment in the face; nor linger thou!\n\nMeet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind\nIn action, and in love so radiant now;\n\nLet all things be where thou art, childlike ever,\n\nThus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never.\"\nThou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide\nThe moment's favour did a god assign,\n\nAnd each one feels himself when by thy side,\nFate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;\n\nI tremble at thy look that bids me go,\n\nWhy should I care such wisdom vast to know?\nNow am I far! And what would best befit\nThe present minute? I could scarcely tell;\n\nFull many a rich possession offers it,\nThese but offend, and I would fain repel.\n\nYearnings unquenchable still drive me on,\n\nAll counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.\nFlow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,\nYet may ye never quench my inward fire!\n\nWithin my bosom heaves a mighty force,\nWhere death and life contend in combat dire.\n\nMedicines may serve the body's pangs to still;\n\nNought but the spirit fails in strength of will,\u2014\nFails in conception; wherefore fails it so?\nA thousand times her image it portrays;\n\nEnchanting now, and now compell'd to go,\nNow indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!\n\nHow could the smallest comfort here be flowing?\n\nThe ebb and flood, the coming and the going!\n                              \nLeave me here now, my life's companions true!\nLeave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;\n\nBut courage! open lies the world to you,\nThe glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;\n\nObserve, investigate, with searching eyes,\n\nAnd nature will disclose her mysteries.\nTo me is all, I to myself am lost,\nWho the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;\n\nThey, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,\nSo rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;\n\nThey urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,\n\nDeserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.\n1823.\nIII.  ATONEMENT.\n\nPASSION brings reason\u2014who can pacify\nAn anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?\n\nWhere are the hours that fled so swiftly by?\nIn vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;\n\nSad is the soul, confused the enterprise;\nThe glorious world, how on the sense it dies!\nIn million tones entwined for evermore,\nMusic with angel-pinions hovers there,\n\nTo pierce man's being to its inmost core,\nEternal beauty has its fruit to bear;\n\nThe eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveres\n\nThe godlike worth of music as of tears.\nAnd so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see\nThat it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,\n\nOff'ring itself with joy and willingly,\nIn grateful payment for a gift so sweet.\n\nAnd then was felt,\u2014oh may it constant prove!\u2014\n\nThe twofold bliss of music and of love."}]}

Your father did wrongly\n\nWhen to the sensitive boy he pointed out death in its own form.\n\nUnto the youth should be shown the worth of a noble and ripen'd\n\nAge, and unto the old man, youth, that both may rejoice in\n\nThe eternal circle, and life may in life be made perfect!\"\nHere the door was open'd. The handsome couple appear'd there,\n\nAnd the friends were amazed, the loving parents astonish'd\n\nAt the form of the bride, the form of the bridegroom resembling.\n\nYes! the door appear'd too small to admit the tall figures\n\nWhich now cross'd the threshold, in company walking together.\n\nTo his parents Hermann presented her, hastily saying:\u2014\n\n\"Here is a maiden just of the sort you are wishing to have here,\n\nWelcome her kindly, dear father! she fully deserves it, and you too,\n\nMother dear, ask her questions as to her housekeeping knowledge,\n\nThat you may see how well she deserves to form one of our party.\"\n\nThen he hastily took on one side the excellent pastor,\n\nSaying:\u2014\" Kind sir, I entreat you to help me out of this trouble\n\nQuickly, and loosen the knot, whose unravelling I am so dreading;\n\nFor I have not ventured to woo as my bride the fair maiden,\n\nBut she believes she's to be a maid in the house, and I fear me\n\nShe will in anger depart, as soon as we talk about marriage.\n\nBut it must be decided at once! no longer in error\n\nShall she remain, and I no longer this doubt can put up with.\n\nHasten and once more exhibit that wisdom we all hold in honour.\"\n\nSo the pastor forthwith turn'd round to the rest of the party,\n\nBut the maiden's soul was, unhappily, troubled already\n\nBy the talk of the father, who just had address'd her as follows,\n\nSpeaking good humour'dly, and in accents pleasant and lively\n\n\"Yes, I'm well satisfied, child! I joyfully see that my son has\n\nJust as good taste as his father, who in his younger days show'd it,\n\nAlways leading the fairest one out in the dance, and then lastly\n\nTaking the fairest one home as his wife\u2014'twas your dear little mother!\n\nFor by the bride whom a man selects, we may easily gather\n\nWhat kind of spirit his is, and whether he knows his own value.\n\nBut you will surely need but a short time to form your decision,\n\nFor I verily think he will find it full easy to follow.\"\n\nHermann but partially heard the words; the whole of his members\n\nInwardly quivered, and all the circle were suddenly silent.\nBut the excellent maiden, by words of such irony wounded,\n(As she esteem'd them to be) and deeply distress'd in her spirit,\nStood, while a passing flush from her cheeks as far as her neck was\nSpreading, but she restrain'd herself, and collected her thoughts soon;\nThen to the old man she said, not fully concealing her sorrow\n\"Truly I was not prepared by your son for such a reception,\nWhen he described his father's nature,\u2014that excellent burgher,\nAnd I know I am standing before you, a person of culture,\nWho behaves himself wisely to all, in a suitable manner.\nBut it would seem that you feel not pity enough for the poor thing\nWho has just cross'd your threshold, prepared to enter your service\nElse you would not seek to point out, with ridicule bitter,\nHow far removed my lot from your son's and that of yourself is.\nTrue, with a little bundle, and poor, I have enter'd your dwelling,\nWhich it is the owner's delight to furnish with all things.\nBut I know myself well, and feel the whole situation.\nIs it generous thus to greet me with language so jeering,\nWhich was well nigh expelled me the house, when just on the threshold?\"\nHermann uneasily moved about, and signed to the pastor\n\nTo interpose without delay, and clear up the error.\n\nQuickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden's\n\nSilent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.\n\nThen his spirit advised him to solve not at once the confusion,\n\nBut, on the contrary, prove the excited mind of the maiden.\n\nSo, in words framed to try her, the pastor address'd her as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Surely, my foreign maiden, you did not fully consider,\n\nWhen you made up your mind to serve a stranger so quickly,\n\nWhat it really is to enter the house of a master;\n\nFor a shake of the hand decides your fate for a twelvemonth,\n\nAnd a single word Yes to much endurance will bind you.\n\nBut the worst part of the service is not the wearisome habits,\n\nNor the bitter toil of the work, which seems never-ending;\n\nFor the active freeman works hard as well as the servant.\n\nBut to suffer the whims of the master, who blames you unjustly,\n\nOr who calls for this and for that, not knowing his own mind,\n\nAnd the mistress's violence, always so easily kindled,\n\nWith the children's rough and supercilious bad manners,\u2014\n\nThis is indeed hard to bear, whilst still fulfilling your duties\n\nPromptly and actively, never becoming morose or ill-natured;\n\nYet for such work you appear little fit, for already the father's\n\nJokes have offended you deeply; yet nothing more commonly happens\n\nThan to tease a maiden about her liking a youngster.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and the maiden felt the weight of his language,\n\nAnd no more restrain'd herself; mightily all her emotions\n\nShow'd themselves, her bosom heaved, and a deep sigh escaped her,\n\nAnd whilst shedding burning tears, she answer'd as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Ne'er does the clever man, who seeks to advise us in sorrow,\n\nThink how little his chilling words our hearts can deliver\n\nFrom the pangs which an unseen destiny fastens upon us.\n\nYou are happy and merry. How then should a jest ever wound you?\n\nBut the slightest touch gives torture to those who are suff'ring.\n\nEven dissimulation would nothing avail me at present.\n\nLet me at once disclose what later would deepen my sorrow,\n\nAnd consign me perchance to agony mute and consuming.\n\nLet me depart forthwith! No more in this house dare I linger;\n\nI must hence and away, and look once more for my poor friends\n\nWhom I left in distress, when seeking to better my fortunes.\n\nThis is my firm resolve; and now I may properly tell you\n\nThat which had else been buried for many a year in my bosom.\n\nYes, the father's jest has wounded me deeply, I own it,\n\nNot that I'm proud and touchy, as ill becometh a servant,\n\nBut because in truth in my heart a feeling has risen\n\nFor the youth, who to-day has fill'd the part of my Saviour.\n\nFor when first in the road he left me, his image remain'd still\n\nFirmly fix'd in my mind; and I thought of the fortunate maiden\n\nWhom, as his betroth'd one, he cherish'd perchance in his bosom.\n\nAnd when I found him again at the well, the sight of him charm'd me\n\nJust as if I had-seen an angel descending from heaven.\n\nAnd I follow'd him willingly, when as a servant he sought me,\n\nBut by my heart in truth I was flatter'd (I need must confess it),\n\nAs I hitherward came, that I might possibly win him,\n\nIf I became in the house an indispensable pillar.\n\nBut, alas, I now see the dangers I well nigh fell into,\n\nWhen I bethought me of living so near a silently-loved one.\n\nNow for the first time I feel how far removed a poor maiden\n\nIs from a richer youth, however clever she may be.\n\nI have told you all this, that you my heart may mistake not,\n\nWhich an event that in thought I foreshadow has wounded already.\n\nFor I must have expected, my secret wishes concealing,\n\nThat, ere much time had elapsed, I should see him bringing his bride home.\n\nAnd how then could I have endured my hidden affliction!\n\nHappily I am warn'd in time, and out of my bosom\n\nHas my secret escaped, whilst curable still is the evil.\n\nBut no more of the subject! I now must tarry no longer\n\nIn this house, where I now am standing in pain and confusion,\n\nAll my foolish hopes and my feelings freely confessing.\n\nNot the night which, with sinking clouds, is spreading around us,\n\nNot the rolling thunder (I hear it already) shall stop me,\n\nNot the falling rain, which outside is descending in torrents,\n\nNot the blustering storm. All this I had to encounter\n\nIn that sorrowful flight, while the enemy follow'd behind Us.\n\nAnd once more I go on my way, as I long have been wont to,\n\nSeized by the whirlpool of time, and parted from all that I care for.\n\nSo farewell! I'll tarry no longer. My fate is accomplish'd!\"\nThus she spoke, and towards the door she hastily turn'd her,\n\nHolding under her arm the bundle she brought when arriving.\n\nBut the mother seized by both of her arms the fair maiden,\n\nClasping her round the body, and cried with surprise and amazement\n\n\"Say, what signifies this? These fruitless tears, what denote they?\n\nNo, I'll not leave you alone! You're surely my dear son's betroth'd one!\"\n\nBut the father stood still, and show'd a great deal of reluctance,\n\nStared at the weeping girl, and peevishly spoke then as follows\n\n\"This, then, is all the indulgence my friends are willing to give me,\n\nThat at the close of the day the most unpleasant thing happens!\n\nFor there is nothing I hate so much as the tears of a woman,\n\nAnd their passionate cries, set up with such heat and excitement,\n\nWhich a little plain sense would show to be utterly needless.\n\nTruly, I find the sight of these whimsical doings a nuisance.\n\nMatters must shift for themselves; as for me, I think it is bed-time.\"\n\nSo he quickly turn'd round, and hasten'd to go to the chamber\n\nWhere the marriage-bed stood, in which he slept for the most part.\n\nBut his son held him back, and spoke in words of entreaty\n\n\"Father, don't go in a hurry, and be not amniote with the maiden!\n\nI alone have to bear the blame of all this confusion,\n\nWhich our friend has increased by his unexpected dissembling.\n\nSpeak then, honour'd Sir! for to you the affair I confided;\n\nHeap not up pain and annoyance, but rather complete the whole matter;\n\nFor I surely in future should not respect you so highly,\n\nIf you play practical jokes, instead of displaying true wisdom.\"\nThereupon the worthy pastor smilingly answer'd\n\n\"What kind of wisdom could have extracted the charming confession\n\nOf this good maiden, and so have reveal'd all her character to us?\n\nIs not your care converted at once to pleasure and rapture?\n\nSpeak out, then, for yourself! Why need explanations from others\n\nHermann then stepped forward, and gently address'd her as follows\n\n\"Do not repent of your tears, nor yet of your passing affliction;\n\nFor they perfect my happiness; yours too, I fain would consider.\n\nI came not to the fountain, to hire so noble a maiden\n\nAs a servant, I came to seek to win you affections.\n\nBut, alas! my timid gaze had not strength to discover\n\nYour heart's leanings; it saw in your eye but a friendly expression,\n\nWhen you greeted it out of the tranquil fountain's bright mirror.\n\nMerely to bring you home, made half of my happiness certain\n\nBut you now make it complete! May every blessing be yours, then!\"\n\nThen the maiden look'd on the youth with heartfelt emotion,\n\nAnd avoided not kiss or embrace, the summit of rapture,\n\nWhen they also are to the loving the long-wish'd-for pledges\n\nOf approaching bliss in a life which now seems to them endless.\n\nThen the pastor told the others the whole of the story;\n\nBut the maiden came and gracefully bent o'er the father,\n\nKissing the while his hand, which he to draw back attempted.\n\nAnd she said:\u2014\" I am sure that you will forgive the surprised one,\n\nFirst for her tears of sorrow, and then for her tears of true rapture.\n\nO forgive the emotions by which they both have been prompted,\n\nAnd let me fully enjoy the bliss that has now been vouchsafed me!\n\nLet the first vexation, which my confusion gave rise to,\n\nAlso be the last! The loving service which lately\n\nWas by the servant promised, shall now by the daughter be render'd.\"\nAnd the father, his tears concealing, straightway embraced her;\n\nLovingly came the mother in turn, and heartily kiss'd her,\n\nWarmly shaking her hand; and silently wept they together.\n\nThen in a hasty manner, the good and sensible pastor\n\nSeized the hand of the father, his wedding-ring off from his finger\n\nDrawing (not easily though; so plump was the member that held it)\n\nThen he took the mother's ring, and betroth'd the two children,\n\nSaying:\u2014\"Once more may it be these golden hoops' destination\n\nFirmly to fasten a bond altogether resembling the old one!\n\nFor this youth is deeply imbued with love for the maiden,\n\nAnd the maiden confesses that she for the youth has a liking.\n\nTherefore, I now betroth you, and wish you all blessings hereafter,\n\nWith the parents' consent, and with our friend here as a witness.\"\nAnd the neighbour bent forward, and added his own benediction;\n\nBut when the clergyman placed the gold ring on the hand of the maiden,\n\nHe with astonishment saw the one which already was on it,\n\nAnd which Hermann before at the fountain had anxiously noticed.\n\nWhereupon he spoke in words at once friendly and jesting\n\n\"What! You are twice engaging yourself? I hope that the first one\n\nMay not appear at the altar, unkindly forbidding the banns there!\"\nBut she said in reply:\u2014\"O let me devote but one moment\n\nTo this mournful remembrance! For well did the good youth deserve it,\n\nWho, when departing, presented the ring, but never return'd home.\n\nAll was by him foreseen, when freedom's love of a sudden,\n\nAnd a desire to play his part in the new-found Existence,\n\nDrove him to go to Paris, where prison and death were his portion.\n\n'Farewell,' said he, 'I go; for all things on earth are in motion\n\nAt this moment, and all things appear in a state of disunion.\n\nFundamental laws in the steadiest countries are loosen'd,\n\nAnd possessions are parted from those who used to possess them,\n\nFriends are parted from friends, and love is parted from love too.\n\nI now leave you here, and whether I ever shall see you\n\nHere again,\u2014who can tell? Perchance these words will our last be.\n\nMan is a stranger here upon earth, the proverb informs us;\n\nEvery person has now become more a stranger than ever.\n\nOurs the soil is no longer; our treasures are fast flying from us;\n\nAll the sacred old vessels of gold and silver are melted,\n\nAll is moving, as though the old-fashion'd world would roll backwards\n\nInto chaos and night, in order anew to be fashion'd.\n\nYou of my heart have possession, and if we shall ever here-after\n\nMeet again over the wreck of the world, it will be as new creatures,\n\nAll remodell'd and free and independent of fortune;\n\nFor what fetters can bind down those who survive such a period!\n\nBut if we are destined not to escape from these dangers,\n\nIf we are never again to embrace each other with raptures\n\nO then fondly keep in your thoughts my hovering image,\n\nThat you may be prepared with like courage for good and ill fortune!\n\nIf a new home or a new alliance should chance to allure you,\n\nThen enjoy with thanks whatever your destiny offers,\n\nPurely loving the loving, and grateful to him who thus loves you.\n\nBut remember always to tread with a circumspect footstep,\n\nFor the fresh pangs of a second loss will behind you be lurking.\n\nDeem each day as sacred; but value not life any higher\n\nThan any other possession, for all possessions are fleeting.'\n\nThus he spoke; and the noble youth and I parted for ever:\n\nMeanwhile I ev'rything lost, and a thousand times thought of his warning.\n\nOnce more I think of his words, now that love is sweetly preparing\n\nHappiness for me anew, and the brightest of hopes is unfolding.\n\nPardon me, dearest friend, for trembling e'en at the moment\n\nWhen I am clasping your arm! For thus, on first landing, the sailor\n\nFancies that even the solid ground is shaking beneath him.\"\nThus she spoke, and she placed the rings by the side of each other.\n\nBut the bridegroom answer'd, with noble and manly emotion\n\n\"All the firmer, amidst the universal disruption,\n\nBe, Dorothea, our union! We'll show ourselves bold and enduring,\n\nFirmly hold our own, and firmly retain our possessions.\n\nFor the man who in wav'ring times is inclined to be wav'ring\n\nOnly increases the evil, and spreads it wider and wider;\n\nBut the man of firm decision the universe fashions.\n\n'Tis not becoming the Germans to further this fearful commotion,\n\nAnd in addition to waver uncertainly hither and thither.\n\n'This is our own!' we ought to say, and so to maintain it!\n\nFor the world will ever applaud those resolute nations\n\nWho for God and the Law, their wives, and parents, and children\n\nStruggle, and fall when contending against the foeman together.\n\nYou are mine; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.\n\nNot with anxiety will I preserve it, or timidly use it,\n\nBut with courage and strength. And if the enemy threaten\n\nNow or hereafter, I'll hold myself ready, and reach down my weapons.\n\nIf I know that the house and my parents by you are protected,\n\nI shall expose my breast to the enemy, void of all terror;\n\nAnd if all others thought thus, then might against might should be measured,\n\nAnd in the early prospect of peace we should all be rejoicing."}]}

KALLIOPE.\n\"NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!\n\nStill as the grave is the town, clear'd out! I verily fancy\n\nFifty at most of all our inhabitants still may be found there.\n\nPeople are so inquisitive! All are running and racing\n\nMerely to see the sad train of poor fellows driven to exile.\n\nDown to the causeway now building, the distance nearly a league is,\n\nAnd they thitherward rush, in the heat and the dust of the noonday.\n\nAs for me, I had rather not stir from my place just to stare at\n\nWorthy and sorrowful fugitives, who, with what goods they can carry,\n\nLeaving their own fair land on the further side of the Rhine-stream,\n\nOver to us are crossing, and wander through the delightful\n\nNooks of this fruitful vale, with all its twistings and windings.\n\nWife, you did right well to bid our son go and meet them,\n\nTaking with him old linen, and something to eat and to drink too,\n\nJust to give to the poor; the rich are bound to befriend them.\n\nHow he is driving along! How well he holds in the horses!\n\nThen the new little carriage looks very handsome; inside it\n\nFour can easily sit, besides the one on the coachbox.\n\nThis time he is alone; how easily-turns it the corner!\"\n\nThus to his wife the host of the Golden Lion discoursed,\n\nSitting at ease in the porch of his house adjoining the market.\n\nThen replied as follows the shrewd and sensible hostess\n\n\"Father, I don't like giving old linen away, for I find it\n\nUseful in so many ways, 'tis not to he purchased for money\n\nJust when it's wanted. And yet to-day I gladly have given\n\nMany excellent articles, shirts and covers and suchlike;\n\nFor I have heard of old people and children walking half-naked.\n\nWill you forgive me, too, for having ransacked your presses?\n\nThat grand dressing-gown, cover'd with Indian flowers all over,\n\nMade of the finest calico, lined with excellent flannel,\n\nI have despatch'd with the rest; 'tis thin, old, quite out of fashion.\"\nBut the worthy landlord only smiled, and then answer'd\n\nI shall dreadfully miss that ancient calico garment,\n\nGenuine Indian stuff! They're not to be had any longer.\n\nWell! I shall wear it no more. And your poor husband henceforward\n\nAlways must wear a surtout, I suppose, or commonplace jacket,\n\nAlways must put on his boots; good bye to cap and to slippers!\"\n\"See,\" continued his wife, \"a few are already returning\n\nWho have seen the procession, which long ago must have pass'd by.\n\nSee how dusty their shoes are, and how their faces are glowing\n\nEach one carries a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.\n\nI, for one, wouldn't hurry and worry myself in such weather\n\nMerely to see such a sight! I'm certain to hear all about it.\"\nAnd the worthy father, speaking with emphasis, added\n\n\"Such fine weather seldom lasts through the whole of the harvest\n\nAnd we're bringing the fruit home, just as the hay we brought lately,\n\nPerfectly dry; the sky is clear, no cloud's in the heavens,\n\nAnd the whole day long delicious breezes are blowing.\n\nSplendid weather I call it! The corn already too ripe is,\n\nAnd to-morrow begin we to gather the plentiful harvest.\"\nWhilst he was thus discoursing, the number of men and of women\n\nCrossing the market and going towards home kept ever increasing;\n\nAnd there return'd amongst others, bringing with him his daughters,\n\nOn the other side of the market, their prosperous neighbour,\n\nGoing full speed to his newbuilt house, the principal merchant,\n\nRiding inside an open carriage (in Landau constructed).\n\nAll the streets were alive; for the town, though small, was well peopled,\n\nMany a factory throve there, and many a business also.\nLong sat the excellent couple under the doorway, exchanging\n\nMany a passing remark on the people who happen'd to pass them.\n\nPresently thus to her husband exclaim'd the good-natured hostess\n\n\"See! Yon comes the minister; with him is walking the druggist:\n\nThey'll be able to give an account of all that has happen'd,\n\nWhat they witness'd, and many a sight I fear which was painful.\"\nBoth of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple,\n\nTaking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway,\n\nShaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.\n\nPresently, after exchanging reciprocal greetings, the druggist\n\nOpen'd his mouth, and almost peevishly vented his feelings\n\n\"What strange creatures men are! They all resemble each other,\n\nAll take pleasure in staring, when troubles fall on their neighbours.\n\nEv'ry one runs to see the flames destroying a dwelling,\n\nOr a poor criminal led in terror and shame to the scaffold.\n\nAll the town has been out to gaze at the sorrowing exiles,\n\nNone of them bearing in mind that a like misfortune hereafter,\n\nPossibly almost directly, may happen to be their own portion.\n\nI can't pardon such levity; yet 'tis the nature of all men.\"\n\nThereupon rejoin'd the noble and excellent pastor,\n\nHe, the charm of the town, in age scarce more than a stripling:\u2014\n\n(He was acquainted with life, and knew the wants of his hearers,\n\nFully convinced of the worth of the Holy Scriptures, whose mission\n\nIs to reveal man's fate, his inclinations to fathom;\n\nHe was also well read in the best of secular writings.)\n\n\"I don't like to find fault with any innocent impulse\n\nWhich in the mind of man Dame Nature has ever implanted;\n\nFor what reason and intellect ne'er could accomplish, is often\n\nDone by some fortunate, quite irresistible instinct within him.\n\nIf mankind were never by curiosity driven,\n\nSay, could they e'er have found out for themselves the wonderful manner\n\nThings in the world range in order? For first they Novelty look for,\n\nThen with untiring industry seek to discover the Useful,\n\nLastly they yearn for the Good, which makes them noble and worthy.\n\nAll through their youth frivolity serves as their joyous companion,\n\nHiding the presence of danger, and. swiftly effacing the traces\n\nCaused by misfortune and grief, as soon as their onslaught is over.\n\nTruly the man's to be praised who, as years roll onward, develops\n\nOut of such glad disposition an intellect settled and steady,\u2014\n\nWho, in good fortune as well as misfortune, strives zealously, nobly;\n\nFor what is Good he brings forth, replacing whatever is injured.\"\n\nThen in a friendly voice impatiently spoke thus the hostess:\u2014\n\n\"Tell us what have you seen; I am eagerly longing to hear it.\"\nThen with emphasis answer'd the druggist:\u2014\" The terrible stories\n\nTold me to-day will serve for a long time to make me unhappy.\n\nWords would fail to describe the manifold pictures of mis'ry.\n\nFar in the distance saw we the dust, before we descended\n\nDown to the meadows; the rising hillocks hid the procession\n\nLong from our eyes, and little could we distinguish about it.\n\nWhen, however, we reach'd the road that winds thro' the valley,\n\nGreat was the crowd and the noise of the emigrants mix'd with the waggons.\n\nWe unhappily saw poor fellows passing in numbers,\n\nSome of them showing how bitter the sense of their sorrowful flight was,\n\nSome with a feeling of joy at saving their lives in a hurry.\n\nSad was the sight of the manifold goods and chattels pertaining\n\nUnto a well-managed house, which the careful owner's accustom'd\n\nEach in its proper position to place, and in regular order,\n\nAlways ready for use, for all are wanted and useful.\u2014\n\nSad was the sight of them now, on many a waggon and barrow\n\nHeap'd in thorough confusion, and hurriedly huddled together.\n\nOver a cupboard was placed a sieve and a coverlet woollen;\n\nBeds in the kneeding troughs lay, and linen over the glasses.\n\nAh! and the danger appear'd to rob the men of their senses,\n\nJust as in our great fire of twenty years ago happen'd,\n\nWhen what was worthless they saved, and left all the best things behind them.\n\nSo on the present occasion with heedless caution they carried\n\nMany valueless chattels, o'erlading the cattle and horses,\u2014\n\nCommon old boards and barrels, a birdcage next to a goosepen.\n\nWomen and children were gasping beneath the weight of their bundles,\n\nBaskets and tubs full of utterly useless articles, bearing.\n\n(Man is always unwilling the least of his goods to abandon.)\n\nThus on its dusty way advanced the crowded procession,\n\nAll in hopeless confusion. First one, whose cattle were weaker,\n\nFain would slowly advance, while others would eagerly hasten.\n\nThen there arose a scream of half-crush'd women and children,\n\nAnd a lowing of cattle, with yelping of dogs intermingled,\n\nAnd a wailing of aged and sick, all sitting and shaking,\n\nRanged in their beds on the top of the waggon too-heavily laden.\n\nNext some lumbering wheel, push'd out of the track by the pressure,\n\nWent to the edge of the roadway; the vehicle fell in the ditch then,\n\nRolling right over, and throwing, in falling, the men who were in it\n\nFar in the field, screaming loudly, their persons however uninjured.\n\nThen the boxes roll'd off and tumbled close to the waggon.\n\nThose who saw them failing full surely expected to see them\n\nSmash'd to pieces beneath the weight of the chests and the presses.\n\nSo the waggon lay broken, and those that it carried were helpless,\n\nFor the rest of the train went on, and hurriedly pass'd them,\n\nThinking only of self, and carried away by the current.\n\nSo we sped to the spot, and found the sick and the aged\n\nWho, when at home and in bed, could scarcely endure their sad ailments,\n\nLying there on the ground, all sighing and groaning in anguish,\n\nStifled by clouds of dust, and scorch'd by the fierce sun of summer.\nThen replied in tones of compassion the sensitive landlord\n\nHermann I trust will find them and give them refreshment and clothing.\n\nI should unwillingly see them: I grieve at the eight of such sorrow.\n\nTouch'd by the earliest news of the sad extent of the suffering,\n\nHastily sent we a trifle from out of our superabundance,\n\nJust to comfort a few, and then our minds were more easy.\n\nNow let us cease to discourse on such a sorrowful subject,\n\nFor men's hearts are easily overshadow'd by terror,\n\nAnd by care, more odious far to me than misfortune.\n\nNow let us go to a cooler place, the little back-parlour;\n\nThere the sun never shines, and the walls are so thick that the hot air\n\nNever can enter; and mother shall forthwith bring us a glass each\n\nFull of fine Eighty-three, well fitted to drive away trouble.\n\nThis is a bad place for drinking; the flies will hum round the glasses.\"\n\nSo they all went inside, enjoying themselves in the coolness.\n\nThen in a well-cut flask the mother carefully brought them\n\nSome of that clear good wine, upon a bright metal waiter\n\nWith those greenish rummers, the fittingest goblets for Rhine wine.\n\nSo the three sat together, around the glistening polish'd\n\nCircular large brown table-\u2500on massive feet it was planted.\n\nMerrily clink'd together the glasses of host and of pastor,\n\nBut the other one thoughtfully held his glass without moving,\n\nAnd in friendly fashion the host thus ask'd him to join them:\u2014\n\"Drink, good neighbour, I pray! A merciful God has protected\n\nUs in the past from misfortune, and will protect us in future.\n\nAll must confess that since He thought fit to severely chastise us,\n\nWhen that terrible fire occurr'd, He has constantly bless'd us.\n\nAnd watch'd over us constantly, just as man is accustom'd\n\nHis eye's precious apple to guard, that dearest of members.\n\nShall He not for the future preserve us, and be our Protector?\n\nFor 'tis in danger we learn to appreciate duly His Goodness.\n\nThis so flourishing town, which He built again from its ashes\n\nBy the industrious hands of its burghers, and bless'd it so richly,\n\nWill He again destroy it, and render their toil unavailing?\"\nCheerfully answer'd the excellent pastor, in accents of mildness\n\n\"Steadfastly cling to this faith, and cherish such worthy opinions;\n\nIn good fortune they'll make you prudent, and then in misfortune\n\nWell-grounded hopes they'll supply, and furnish you true consolation.\"\nThen continued the host, with thoughts full of manhood and wisdom\n\n\"Oft have I greeted with wonder the rolling flood of the Rhine stream,\n\nWhen, on my business trav'lling, I've once more come to its borders.\n\nGrand has it ever appear'd, exalting my feelings and senses;\n\nBut I could never imagine that soon its beautiful margin\n\nInto a wall would be turn'd, to keep the French from our country,\n\nAnd its wide-spreading bed a ditch to hinder and check them.\n\nSo by Nature we're guarded, we're guarded by valorous Germans,\n\nAnd by the Lord we're guarded; who then would foolishly tremble?\n\nWeary the combatants are, and all things indicate peace soon;\n\nAnd when at length the long-expected festival's holden\n\nHere in our church, and the bells chime in with the organ in chorus,\n\nAnd the trumpets are blowing, the noble Te Deum upraising,\n\nThen on that selfsame day I fain would see, my good pastor,\n\nOur dear Hermann kneel with his bride at the altar before you,\n\nAnd the glad festival held through the length and breadth of the country\n\nWill henceforward to me be a glad anniversary also!\n\nBut I am grieved to observe that the youth, who is always so active\n\nWhen he is here at home, abroad is so slow and so timid.\n\nLittle at any time cares he to mix with the rest of the people;\n\nYes, he even avoids young maidens' society ever,\n\nAnd the frolicsome dance, that great delight of young people.\"\nThus he spake, and then listen'd. The sound of the stamping of horses\n\nDrawing nearer was heard; and then the roll of the carriage,\n\nWhich, with impetuous speed, now thunder'd under the gateway."}]}

Oh, dearest friend, could I only\nHappily teach thee the word, which may the mystery solve!\n\nClosely observe how the plant, by little and little progressing,\nStep by step guided on, changeth to blossom and fruit!\n\nFirst from the seed it unravels itself, as soon as the silent\nFruit-bearing womb of the earth kindly allows Its escape,\n\nAnd to the charms of the light, the holy, the ever-in-motion,\nTrusteth the delicate leaves, feebly beginning to shoot.\n\nSimply slumber'd the force in the seed; a germ of the future,\nPeacefully lock'd in itself, 'neath the integument lay,\n\nLeaf and root, and bud, still void of colour, and shapeless;\nThus doth the kernel, while dry, cover that motionless life.\n\nUpward then strives it to swell, in gentle moisture confiding,\nAnd, from the night where it dwelt, straightway ascendeth to light.\n\nYet still simple remaineth its figure, when first it appeareth;\nAnd 'tis a token like this, points out the child 'mid the plants.\n\nSoon a shoot, succeeding it, riseth on high, and reneweth,\nPiling-up node upon node, ever the primitive form;\n\nYet not ever alike: for the following leaf, as thou seest,\nEver produceth itself, fashioned in manifold ways.\n\nLonger, more indented, in points and in parts more divided,\nWhich. all-deform'd until now, slept in the organ below,\n\nSo at length it attaineth the noble and destined perfection,\nWhich, in full many a tribe, fills thee with wondering awe.\n\nMany ribb'd and tooth'd, on a surface juicy and swelling,\nFree and unending the shoot seemeth in fullness to be;\n\nYet here Nature restraineth, with powerful hands, the formation,\nAnd to a perfecter end, guideth with softness its growth,\n\nLess abundantly yielding the sap, contracting the vessels,\nSo that the figure ere long gentler effects doth disclose.\n\nSoon and in silence is check'd the growth of the vigorous branches,\nAnd the rib of the stalk fuller becometh in form.\n\nLeafless, however, and quick the tenderer stem then up-springeth,\nAnd a miraculous sight doth the observer enchant.\n\nRanged in a circle, in numbers that now are small, and now countless,\nGather the smaller-sized leaves, close by the side of their like.\n\nRound the axis compress'd the sheltering calyx unfoldeth,\nAnd, as the perfectest type, brilliant-hued coronals forms.\n\nThus doth Nature bloom, in glory still nobler and fuller,\nShowing, in order arranged, member on member uprear'd.\n\nWonderment fresh dost thou feel, as soon as the stem rears the flower\nOver the scaffolding frail of the alternating leaves.\n\nBut this glory is only the new creation's foreteller,\nYes, the leaf with its hues feeleth the hand all divine,\n\nAnd on a sudden contracteth itself; the tenderest figures\nTwofold as yet, hasten on, destined to blend into one.\n\nLovingly now the beauteous pairs are standing together,\nGather'd in countless array, there where the altar is raised.\n\nHymen hovereth o'er them, and scents delicious and mighty\nStream forth their fragrance so sweet, all things enliv'ning around.\n\nPresently, parcell'd out, unnumber'd germs are seen swelling,\nSweetly conceald in the womb, where is made perfect the fruit.\n\nHere doth Nature close the ring of her forces eternal;\nYet doth a new one, at once, cling to the one gone before,\n\nSo that the chain be prolonged for ever through all generations,\nAnd that the whole may have life, e'en as enjoy'd by each part.\n\nNow, my beloved one, turn thy gaze on the many-hued thousands\nWhich, confusing no more, gladden the mind as they wave.\n\nEvery plant unto thee proclaimeth the laws everlasting,\nEvery flowered speaks louder and louder to thee;\n\nBut if thou here canst decipher the mystic words of the goddess,\nEverywhere will they be seen, e'en though the features are changed.\n\nCreeping insects may linger, the eager butterfly hasten,\u2014\nPlastic and forming, may man change e'en the figure decreed!\n\nOh, then, bethink thee, as well, how out of the germ of acquaintance,\nKindly intercourse sprang, slowly unfolding its leaves;\n\nSoon how friendship with might unveil'd itself in our bosoms,\nAnd how Amor, at length, brought forth blossom and fruit\n\nThink of the manifold ways wherein Nature hath lent to our feelings,\nSilently giving them birth, either the first or the last!\n\nYes, and rejoice in the present day!

For the sake of the mast'ry\n\nStrove a contemptible crew, unfit to accomplish good actions.\n\nThen they murder'd each other, and took to oppressing their new-found\n\nNeighbours and brothers, and sent on missions whole herds of self\u2500seekers\n\nAnd the superiors took to carousing and robbing by wholesale,\n\nAnd the inferiors down to the lowest caroused and robb'd also.\n\nNobody thought of aught else than having enough for tomorrow.\n\nTerrible was the distress, and daily increased the oppression.\n\nNone the cry understood, that they of the day were the masters.\n\nThen even temperate minds were attack'd by sorrow and fury;\n\nEach one reflected, and swore to avenge all the injuries suffer'd,\n\nAnd to atone for the hitter loss of hopes twice defrauded.\n\nPresently Fortune declared herself on the side of the Germans,\n\nAnd the French were compell'd to retreat by forced marches before them.\n\nAh! the sad fate of the war we then for the first time experienced.\n\nFor the victor is kind and humane, at least he appears so,\n\nAnd he spares the man he has vanquish'd, as if he his own were,\n\nWhen he employs him daily, and with his property helps him.\n\nBut the fugitive knows no law; he wards off death only,\n\nAnd both quickly and recklessly all that he meets with, consumes he.\n\nThen his mind becomes heated apace; and soon desperation\n\nFills his heart, and impels him to all kinds of criminal actions.\n\nNothing then holds he respected, he steals It. With furious longing\n\nOn the woman he rushes; his lust becomes awful to think of.\n\nDeath all around him he sees, his last minutes in cruelty spends he,\n\nWildly exulting in blood, and exulting in howls and in anguish.\n\"Then in the minds of our men arose a terrible yearning\n\nThat which was lost to avenge, and that which remain'd to defend still.\n\nAll of them seized upon arms, lured on by the fugitives' hurry,\n\nBy their pale faces, and by their shy, uncertain demeanour.\n\nThere was heard the sound of alarm-bells unceasingly ringing,\n\nAnd the approach of danger restrain'd not their violent fury.\n\nSoon into weapons were turn'd the implements peaceful of tillage,\n\nAnd with dripping blood the scythe and the pitchfork were cover'd.\n\nEvery foeman without distinction was ruthlessly slaughter'd,\n\nFury was ev'rywhere raging, and artful, cowardly weakness.\n\nMay I never again see men in such wretched confusion!\n\nEven the raging wild beast is a better object to gaze on.\n\nNe'er let them speak of freedom, as if themselves they could govern!\n\nAll the evil which Law has driven farback in the corner\n\nSeems to escape, as soon as the fetters which bound it are loosen'd.\"\n\"Excellent man,\" replied the pastor, with emphasis speaking\n\n\"If you're mistaken in man, 'tis not for me to reprove you.\n\nEvil enough have you suffer'd indeed from his cruel proceedings!\n\nWould you but look back, however, on days so laden with sorrow,\n\nYou would yourself confess how much that is good you have witness'd,\n\nMuch that is excellent, which remains conceald in the bossom\n\nTill by danger 'tis stirr'd, and till necessity makes man\n\nShow himself as an angel, a tutelar God unto others.\"\nThen with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying\n\n\"Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rer\n\nWho has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins,\n\nGold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.\n\nLittle, indeed, it may be, and yet that little is precious,\n\nAnd the poor man digs it up, and rejoices at finding the treasure.\n\nGladly, therefore, I turn my thoughts to those few worthy actions\n\nWhich my memory still is able to dwell on with pleasure.\n\nYes, I will not deny it, I saw late foemen uniting\n\nSo as to save the town from harm; I saw with devotion\n\nParents, children and friends impossible actions attempting,\n\nSaw how the youth of a sudden became a man, how the greybeard\n\nOnce more was young, how the child as a stripling appear'd in a moment.\n\nAye, and the weaker sex, as people commonly call it,\n\nShow'd itself brave and daring, with presence of mind all-unwonted.\n\nLet me now, in the first place, describe a deed of rare merit\n\nBy a high-spirited girl accomplish'd, an excellent maiden,\n\nWho in the great farmhouse remain'd behind with the servants,\n\nWhen the whole of the men had departed, to fight with the strangers.\n\nWell, there fell on the court a troop of vagabond scoundrels,\n\nPlund'ring and forcing their way inside the rooms of the women.\n\nSoon they cast their eyes on the forms of the grown-up fair maiden\n\nAnd of the other dear girls, in age little more than mere children.\n\nHurried away by raging desire, unfeelingly rush'd they\n\nOn the trembling band, and on the high-spirited maiden.\n\nBut she instantly seized the sword from the side of a ruffian,\n\nHew'd him down to the ground; at her feet straight fell he, all bleeding,\n\nThen with doughty strokes the maidens she bravely deliver'd.\n\nWounded four more of the robbers; with life, however, escaped they.\n\nThen she lock'd up the court, and, arm'd still, waited for succour.\nWhen the pastor heard the praise of the maiden thus utter'd\n\nFeelings of hope for his friend forthwith arose in his bosom,\n\nAnd he prepared to ask what had been the fate of the damsel,\n\nWhether she, in the sorrowful flight, form'd one of the people?\n\nAt this moment, however, the druggist nimbly approach'd them,\n\nPull'd the sleeve of the pastor, and whisper'd to him as follows\n\n\"I have at last pick'd out the maiden from many a hundred\n\nBy her description! Pray come and judge for yourself with your own eyes;\n\nBring the magistrate with you, that we may learn the whole story.\"\nSo they turn'd themselves round; but the magistrate found himself summon'd\n\nBy his own followers, who had need of his presence and counsel.\n\nBut the pastor forthwith the druggist accompanied, till they\n\nCame to a gap in the hedge, when the latter pointed with slyness,\n\n\"See you,\" exclaim'd he, \"the maiden? The child's clothes she has been changing.\n\nAnd I recognise well the old calico\u2014also the cushion\u2014\n\nCover of blue, which Hermann took in the bundle and gave her.\n\nQuickly and well, of a truth, she has used the presents left with her.\n\nThese are evident proofs; and all the rest coincide too;\n\nFor a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,\n\nPrettily tied, while black are the stays fitting close around her.\n\nThen the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,\n\nWhich, with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling;\n\nFree and joyously rises her head, with its elegant oval,\n\nStrongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted.\n\nWhen she is sitting, we plainly see her noble proportions,\n\nAnd the blue well-plaited gown which begins from close to her bosom,\n\nAnd in rich folds descending, her well-turn'd ankles envelops.\n\n'Tis she, beyond all doubt. So come, that we may examine\n\nWhether she be both a good and a frugal and virtuous maiden.\"\n\nThen the pastor rejoin'd, the sitting damsel inspecting\n\n\"That she enchanted the youth, I confess is no matter of wonder,\n\nFor she stands the test of the gaze of a man of experience.\n\nHappy the person to whom Mother Nature the right face has given!\n\nShe recommends him at all times, he never appears as a stranger,\n\nEach one gladly approaches, and each one beside him would linger,\n\nIf with his face is combined a pleasant and courteous demeanour.\n\nYes, I assure you the youth has indeed discover'd a maiden\n\nWho the whole of the days of his life will enliven with gladness,\n\nAnd with her womanly strength assist him at all times and truly.\n\nThus a perfect body preserves the soul also in pureness,\n\nAnd a vigorous youth of a happy old age gives assurance.\nAfter reflecting a little, the druggist made answer as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Yet appearances oft are deceitful. I trust not the outside.\n\nOften, indeed, have I found the truth of the proverb which tells us\n\nEre you share a bushel of salt with a new-found acquaintance,\n\nDo not trust him too readily; time will make you more certain\n\nHow you and he will get on, and whether your friendship is lasting.\n\nLet us then, in the first place, inquire amongst the good people\n\nUnto whom the maiden is known, who can tell us about her.\"\n\"Well, of a truth I commend your prudence,\" the pastor continued\n\n\"Not for ourselves are we wooing! To woo for others is serious.\"\n\nSo they started to meet the worthy magistrate seeing\n\nHow in the course of his business he was ascending the main street.\n\nAnd the wise pastor straightway address'd him with foresight as follows\n\n\"We, by-the-bye, have just seen a girl in the neighbouring garden\n\nUnder an apple-tree sitting, and clothes for the children preparing,\n\nMade of worn calico, which for the purpose was doubtless presented.\n\nWe were pleased by her face; she appears to be one of the right sort.\n\nTell us, what know you about her? We ask from a laudable motive.\"\nWhen the magistrate came to the garden and peep'd in, exclaimed he\n\n\"Well do I know her, in truth; for when I told you the story\n\nOf that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,\n\nHow she seized on the sword, and defended herself, and the servants,\n\nShe the heroine was! You can see how active her nature.\n\nBut she's as good as she's strong; for her aged kinsman she tended\n\nUntil the time of his death, for he died overwhelm'd by affliction\n\nAt the distress of his town, and the danger his goods were exposed to.\n\nAlso with mute resignation she bore the grievous affliction\n\nOf her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incited\n\nBy the first fire of noble thoughts to struggle for freedom,\n\nWent himself to Paris, and soon found a terrible death there.\n\nFor, as at home, so there, he fought 'gainst intrigue and oppression.\"\nThus the magistrate spoke. The others departed and thanked him,\n\nAnd the pastor produced a gold piece (the silver his purse held\n\nHe some hours before had with genuine kindness expended\n\nWhen he saw the fugitives passing in sorrowful masses).\nAnd to the magistrate handed it, saying:\u2014\" Divide it, I pray you,\n\n'Mongst those who need it the most. May God give it prosperous increase.\"\nBut the man refused to accept it, and said:\u2014\"I assure you,\n\nMany a dollar we've saved, and plenty of clothing and such things,\n\nAnd I trust we may reach our homes before they are finish'd.\"\nThen continued the pastor, the gold in his hand once more placing\n\n\"None should delay to give in days like the present, and no one\n\nOught to refuse to receive what is offer'd with liberal kindness.\n\nNo one can tell how long he will keep what in peace he possesses,\n\nNo one, how long he is doom'd in foreign countries to wander,\n\nWhile he's deprived of the field and the garden by which he is nurtured.\"\n\"Bravo!\" added in turn the druggist, with eagerness speaking\n\n\"Had I but money to spare in my pocket, you surely should have it,\n\nSilver and gold alike; for your followers certainly need it.\n\nYet I'll not leave you without a present, if only to show you\n\nMy good will, and I hope you will take the will for the action.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and pull'd out by the strings the leather embroider'd\n\nPouch, in which he was wont his stock of tobacco to carry,\n\nDaintily open'd and shared its contents\u2014some two or three pipes' full.\n\n\"Small in truth is the gift,\" he added. The magistrate answered:\n\n\"Good tobacco is always a welcome present to trav'llers.\"\n\nThen the druggist began his canister to praise very highly.\n\nBut the pastor drew him away, and the magistrate left them.\n\n\"Come, let us hasten!\" exclaimed the sensible man, \"for our young friend\n\nAnxiously waits; without further delay let him hear the good tidings.\"\nSo they hasten'd and came, and found that the youngster was leaning\n\n'Gainst his carriage under the lime-trees. The horses were pawing\n\nWildly the turf; he held them in check and stood there all pensive,\n\nSilently gazing in front, and saw not his friends coming near him,\n\nTill, as they came, they called him and gave him signals of triumph.\n\nSome way off the druggist already began to address him,\n\nBut they approach'd the youth still nearer, and then the good pastor\n\nSeized his hand and spoke and took the word from his comrade\n\n\"Friend, I wish you joy! Your eye so true and your true heart\n\nRightly have chosen! May you and the wife of your young days be happy!\n\nShe is full worthy of you; so come and turn around the carriage,\n\nThat we may reach without delay the end of the village,\n\nSo as to woo her, and shortly escort the dear creature home with us.\"\n\nBut the youth stood still, and without any token of pleasure\n\nHeard the words of the envoy, though sounding consoling and heav'nly,\n\nDeeply sigh'd and said:\u2014\"We came full speed in the carriage\n\nAnd shall probably go back home ashamed and but slowly;\n\nFor, since I have been waiting care has fallen upon me,\n\nDoubt and suspicion and all that a heart full of love is exposed to.\n\nDo you suppose we have only to come, for the maiden to follow,\n\nJust because we are rich, and she poor and wandering in exile?\n\nPoverty, when undeserved, itself makes proud. The fair maiden\n\nSeems to be active and frugal; the world she may claim as her portion.\n\nDo you suppose that a woman of such great beauty and manners\n\nCan have grown up without exciting love in man's bosom?\n\nDo you suppose that her heart until now has to love been fast closed?\n\nDo not drive thither in haste, for perchance to our shame and confusion\n\nWe shall have slowly to turn towards home the heads of our horses.\n\nYes, some youth, I fear me, possesses her heart, and already\n\nShe has doubtless promised her hand and her solemn troth plighted,\n\nAnd I shall stand all ashamed before her, When making my offer.\"\nThen the pastor proceeded to cheer him with words of good comfort,\n\nBut his companion broke in, in his usual talkative manner\n\n\"As things used to be, this embarrassment would not have happened,\n\nWhen each matter was brought to a close in an orthodox fashion.\n\nThen for their son themselves the bride the parents selected,\n\nAnd a friend of the house was secretly call'd in the first place.\n\nHe was then quietly sent as a suitor to visit the parents\n\nOf the selected bride; and, dress'd in his gayest apparel,\n\nWent after dinner some Sunday to visit the excellent burgher,\n\nAnd began by exchanging polite remarks on all subjects,\n\nCleverly turning and bending the talk in the proper direction.\n\nAfter long beating about the bush, he flatter'd the daughter,\n\nAnd spoke well of the man and the house that gave his commission.\n\nSensible people soon saw his drift, and the sensible envoy\n\nWatch'd how the notion was taken, and then could explain himself farther.\n\nIf they declined the proposal, why then the refusal cost nothing,\n\nBut if all prosper'd, why then the suitor for ever thereafter\n\nPlay'd the first fiddle at every family feast and rejoicing.\n\nFor the married couple remember'd the whole of their lifetime\n\nWhose was the skilful hand by which the marriage knot tied was.\n\nAll this now is chang'd, and with many an excellent custom\n\nHas gone quite out of fashion. Each person woos for himself now.\n\nEveryone now must bear the weight of a maiden's refusal\n\nOn his own shoulders, and stand all ashamed before her, if needs be.\"\n\"Let that be as it may,\" then answered the young man who scarcely\n\nHeard what was said, and his mind had made up already in silence\n\n\"I will go myself, and out of the mouth of the maiden\n\nLearn my own fate, for towards her I cherish the most trustful feelings\n\nThat any man ever cherish'd towards any woman whatever.\n\nThat which she says will be good and sensible,\u2014this I am sure of.\n\nIf I am never to see her again, I must once more behold her,\n\nAnd the ingenuous gaze of her black eyes must meet for the last time.\n\nIf to my heart I may clasp her never, her bosom and shoulders\n\nI would once more see, which my arm so longs to encircle:\n\nOnce more the mouth I would see, from which one kiss and a Yes will\n\nMake me happy for ever, a No for ever undo me.\n\nBut now leave me alone! Wait here no longer. Return you\n\nStraight to my father and mother, in order to tell them in person\n\nThat their son was right, and that the maiden is worthy.\n\nAnd so leave me alone! I myself shall return by the footpath\n\nOver the hill by the pear-tree and then descend through the vineyard,\n\nWhich is the shortest way back. Oh may I soon with rejoicing\n\nTake the beloved one home! But perchance all alone I must slink back\n\nBy that path to our house and tread it no more with a light heart.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and then placed the reins in the hands of the pastor,\n\nWho, in a knowing way both the foaming horses restraining,\n\nNimbly mounted the carriage, and took the seat of the driver.\nBut you still delay'd, good cautious neighbour, and spoke thus\n\nFriend, I will gladly entrust to you soul, and spirit, and mind too,\n\nBut my body and bones are not preserved in the best way\n\nWhen the hand of a parson such worldly matters as reins grasps!\"\nBut you smiled in return, you sensible pastor, replying\n\n\"Pray jump in, nor fear with both body and spirit to trust me,\n\nFor this hand to hold the reins has long been accustom'd,\n\nAnd these eyes are train'd to turn the corner with prudence.\n\nFor we were wont to drive the carriage, when living at Strasburg,\n\nAt the time when with the young baron I went there, for daily,\n\nDriven by me, through the echoing gateway thunder'd the carriage\n\nBy the dusty roads to distant meadows and lindens,\n\nThrough the crowds of the people who spend their lifetime in walking.\"\nPartially comforted, then his neighbour mounted the carriage,\n\nSitting like one prepared to make a wise jump, if needs be,\n\nAnd the stallions, eager to reach their stables, coursed homewards,\n\nWhile beneath their powerful hoofs the dust rose in thick clouds.\n\nLong there stood the youth, and saw the dust rise before him,\n\nSaw the dust disperse; but still he stood there, unthinking."}]}

We are surrounded by her and locked in her clasp: powerless to leave her, and powerless to come closer to her. Unasked and unwarned she takes us up into the whirl of her dance, and hurries on with us till we are weary and fall from her arms.\n\nShe creates new forms without end: what exists now, never was before; what was, comes not again; all is new and yet always the old.\n\nWe live in the midst of her and are strangers. She speaks to us unceasingly and betrays not her secret. We are always influencing her and yet can do her no violence.\n\nIndividuality seems to be all her aim, and she cares nought for individuals. She is always building and always destroying, and her workshop is not to be approached.\n\nNature lives in her children only, and the mother, where is she? She is the sole artist,\u2014out of the simplest materials the greatest diversity; attaining, with no trace of effort, the finest perfection, the closest precision, always softly veiled. Each of her works has an essence of its own; every shape that she takes is in idea utterly isolated; and yet all forms one.\n\nShe plays a drama; whether she sees it herself, we know not; and yet she plays it for us, who stand but a little way off.\n\nThere is constant life in her, motion and development; and yet she remains where she was. She is eternally changing, nor for a moment does she stand still. Of rest she knows nothing, and to all stagnation she has affixed her curse. She is steadfast; her step is measured, her exceptions rare, her laws immutable.\n\nShe has thought, and she ponders unceasingly; not as a man, but as Nature. The meaning of the whole she keeps to herself, and no one can learn it of her.\n\nMen are all in her, and she in all men. With all she plays a friendly game, and rejoices the more a man wins from her. With many her game is so secret, that she brings it to an end before they are aware of it.\n\nEven what is most unnatural is Nature; even the coarsest Philistinism has something of her genius. Who does not see her everywhere, sees her nowhere aright.\n\nShe loves herself, and clings eternally to herself with eyes and hearts innumerable. She has divided herself that she may be her own delight. She is ever making new creatures spring up to delight in her, and imparts herself insatiably.\n\nShe rejoices in illusion. If a man destroys this in himself and others, she punishes him like the hardest tyrant. If he follows her in confidence, she presses him to her heart as it were her child.\n\nHer children are numberless. To no one of them is she altogether niggardly; but she has her favourites, on whom she lavishes much, and for whom she makes many a sacrifice. Over the great she has spread the shield of her protection.\n\nShe spurts forth her creatures out of nothing, and tells them not whence they come and whither they go. They have only to go their way: she knows the path.\n\nHer springs of action are few, but they never wear out: they are always working, always manifold.\n\nThe drama she plays is always new, because she is always bringing new spectators. Life is her fairest invention, and Death is her device for having life in abundance.\n\nShe envelops man in darkness, and urges him constantly to the light. She makes him dependent on the earth, heavy and sluggish, and always rouses him up afresh.\n\nShe creates wants, because she loves movement. How marvellous that she gains it all so easily! Every want is a benefit, soon satisfied, soon growing again. If she gives more, it is a new source of desire; but the balance quickly rights itself.\n\nEvery moment she starts on the longest journeys, and every moment reaches her goal.\n\nShe amuses herself with a vain show; but to us her play is all-important.\n\nShe lets every child work at her, every fool judge of her, and thousands pass her by and see nothing; and she has her joy in them all, and in them all finds her account.\n\nMan obeys her laws even in opposing them: he works with her even when he wants to work against her.\n\nEverything she gives is found to be good, for first of all she makes it indispensable. She lingers, that we may long for presence; she hurries by, that we may not grow weary of her.\n\nSpeech or language she has none; but she creates tongues and hearts through which she feels and speaks.\n\nHer crown is Love. Only through Love can we come near her. She puts gulfs between all things, and all things strive to be interfused. She isolates everything, that she may draw everything together. With a few draughts from the cup of Love she repays for a life full of trouble.\n\nShe is all things. She rewards herself and punishes herself; and in herself rejoices and is distressed. She is rough and gentle, loving and terrible, powerless and almighty. In her everything is always present. Past or Future she knows not. The Present is her Eternity. She is kind. I praise her with all her works. She is wise and still. No one can force her to explain herself, or frighten her into a gift that she does not give willingly.

The clearness of day it resembles.\n\nYonder I see in the town the houses and courtyards quite plainly,\n\nIn the gable a window; methinks all the panes I can reckon.\"\n\"That which you see,\" replied the youth, who spoke with an effort,\n\n\"That is our house down to which I now am about to conduct you,\n\nAnd that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,\n\nWhich will probably soon be yours, as we're making great changes.\n\nAll these fields are ours, and ripe for the harvest to-morrow;\n\nHere in the shade we are wont to rest, enjoying our meal-time.\n\nBut let us now descend across the vineyard and garden,\n\nFor observe how the threatening storm is hitherward rolling,\n\nLightening first, and then eclipsing the beautiful full moon.\"\n\nSo the pair arose, and wauder'd down by the corn-field,\nThrough the powerful corn, in the nightly clearness rejoicing;\n\nAnd they reach'd the vineyard, and through its dark shadows proceeded.\n\nSo he guided her down the numerous tiers of the flat stones\n\nWhich, in an unhewn state, served as steps to the walk through the foliage.\n\nSlowly she descended, and placed her hands on his shoulders;\n\nAnd, with a quivering light, the moon through the foliage o'erlook'd them,\n\nTill by storm-clouds envelop'd, she left the couple in darkness.\n\nThen the strong youth supported the maiden, who on him was leaning;\n\nShe, however, not knowing the path, or observing the rough steps,\n\nSlipp'd as she walk'd, her foot gave way, and she well nigh was falling.\n\nHastily held out his arm the youth with nimbleness thoughtful,\n\nAnd held up his beloved one; she gently sank on his shoulders,\n\nBreast was press'd against breast, and cheek against cheek, and so stood he\n\nFix'd like a marble statue, restrained by a firm resolution;\n\nHe embraced her no closer, thoughall her weight he supported;\n\nSo he felt his noble burden, the warmth of her bosom,\n\nAnd her balmy breath, against his warm lips exhaling,\n\nBearing with manly feelings the woman's heroical greatness.\nBut she conceal'd the pain which she felt, and jestingly spoke thus\n\n\"It betokens misfortune,\u2014so scrupulous people inform us,\u2014\n\nFor the foot to give way on entering a house, near the threshold.\n\nI should have wish'd, in truth, for a sign of some happier omen!\n\nLet us tarry a little, for fear your parents should blame you\n\nFor their limping servant, and you should be thought a bad landlord.\""}]}

fair;\n\nWith footing firm she took her place,\n\nAnd moved with stately, noble grace;\n\nShe did not walk in wanton mood,\n\nNor look around with glances lewd.\nShe held a measure in her hand,\n\nHer girdle was a golden band,\n\nA wreath of corn was on her head,\n\nHer eye the day's bright lustre shed;\n\nHer name is honest Industry,\n\nElse, Justice, Magnanimity.\nShe enter'd with a kindly greeting;\n\nHe felt no wonder at the meeting,\n\nFor, kind and fair as she might be,\n\nHe long had known her, fancied he.\n\"I have selected thee,\" she said,\n\n\"From all who earth's wild mazes tread,\n\nThat thou shouldst have clear-sighted sense,\n\nAnd nought that's wrong shouldst e'er commence.\n\nWhen others run in strange confusion,\n\nThy gaze shall see through each illusion\n\nWhen others dolefully complain,\n\nThy cause with jesting thou shalt gain,\n\nHonour and right shalt value duly,\n\nIn everything act simply, truly,\u2014\n\nVirtue and godliness proclaim,\n\nAnd call all evil by its name,\n\nNought soften down, attempt no quibble,\n\nNought polish up, nought vainly scribble.\n\nThe world shall stand before thee, then,\n\nAs seen by Albert Durer's ken,\n\nIn manliness and changeless life,\n\nIn inward strength, with firmness rife.\n\nFair Nature's Genius by the hand\n\nShall lead thee on through every land,\n\nTeach thee each different life to scan,\n\nShow thee the wondrous ways of man,\n\nHis shifts, confusions, thrustings, and drubbings,\n\nPushings, tearings, pressings, and rubbings;\n\nThe varying madness of the crew,\n\nThe anthill's ravings bring to view;\n\nBut thou shalt see all this express'd,\n\nAs though 'twere in a magic chest.\n\nWrite these things down for folks on earth,\n\nIn hopes they may to wit give birth.\"\u2014\n\nThen she a window open'd wide,\n\nAnd show'd a motley crowd outside,\n\nAll kinds of beings 'neath the sky,\n\nAs in his writings one may spy.\nOur master dear was, after this,\n\nOn Nature thinking, full of bliss,\n\nWhen tow'rd him, from the other side\n\nHe saw an aged woman glide;\n\nThe name she bears, Historia,\n\nMythologia, Fabula;\n\nWith footstep tottering and unstable\n\nShe dragg'd a large and wooden carved-table,\n\nWhere, with wide sleeves and human mien,\n\nThe Lord was catechizing seen;\n\nAdam, Eve, Eden, the Serpent's seduction,\n\nGomorrah and Sodom's awful destruction,\n\nThe twelve illustrious women, too,\n\nThat mirror of honour brought to view;\n\nAll kinds of bloodthirstiness, murder, and sin,\n\nThe twelve wicked tyrants also were in,\n\nAnd all kinds of goodly doctrine and law;\n\nSaint Peter with his scourge you saw,\n\nWith the world's ways dissatisfied,\n\nAnd by our Lord with power supplied.\n\nHer train and dress, behind and before,\n\nAnd e'en the seams, were painted o'er\n\nWith tales of worldly virtue and crime.\u2014\n\nOur master view'd all this for a time;\n\nThe sight right gladly he survey'd,\n\nSo useful for him in his trade,\n\nWhence he was able to procure\n\nExample good and precept sure,\n\nRecounting all with truthful care,\n\nAs though he had been present there.\n\nHis spirit seem'd from earth to fly,\n\nHe ne'er had turned away his eye,\n\nDid he not just behind him hear\n\nA rattle of bells approaching near.\n\nAnd now a fool doth catch his eye,\n\nWith goat and ape's leap drawing nigh\n\nA merry interlude preparing\n\nWith fooleries and jests unsparing.\n\nBehind him, in a line drawn out,\n\nHe dragg'd all fools, the lean and stout,\n\nThe great and little, the empty and full,\n\nAll too witty, and all too dull,\n\nA lash he flourish'd overhead,\n\nAs though a dance of apes he led,\n\nAbusing them with bitterness,\n\nAs though his wrath would ne'er grow less.\nWhile on this sight our master gazed,\n\nHis head was growing well-nigh crazed:\n\nWhat words for all could he e'er find,\n\nCould such a medley be combined?\n\nCould he continue with delight\n\nFor evermore to sing and write?\n\nWhen lo, from out a cloud's dark bed\n\nIn at the upper window sped\n\nThe Muse, in all her majesty,\n\nAs fair as our loved maids we see.\n\nWith clearness she around him threw\n\nHer truth, that ever stronger grew.\n\"I, to ordain thee come,\" she spake:\n\n\"So prosper, and my blessing take!\n\nThe holy fire that slumb'ring lies\n\nWithin thee, in bright flames shall rise;\n\nYet that thine ever-restless life\n\nMay still with kindly strength be rife,\n\nI, for thine inward spirit's calm.\n\nHave granted nourishment and balm,\n\nThat rapture may thy soul imbue,\n\nLike some fair blossom bathed in dew.\"\u2014\n\nBehind his house then secretly\n\nOutside the doorway pointed she,\n\nWhere, in a shady garden-nook,\n\nA beauteous maid with downcast look\n\nWas sitting where a stream was flowing,\n\nWith elder bushes near it growing,\n\nShe sat beneath an apple tree,\n\nAnd nought around her seem'd to see.\n\nHer lap was full of roses fair,\n\nWhich in a wreath she twined with care.\n\nAnd, with them, leaves and blossoms blended:\n\nFor whom was that sweet wreath intended?\n\nThus sat she, modest and retired,\n\nHer bosom throbb'd, with hope inspired;\n\nSuch deep forebodings fill'd her mind,\n\nNo room for wishing could she find,\n\nAnd with the thoughts that o'er it flew,\n\nPerchance a sigh was mingled too.\n\"But why should sorrow cloud thy brow?\n\nThat, dearest love, which fills thee now\n\nIs fraught with joy and ecstasy.\n\nPrepared in one alone for thee,\n\nThat he within thine eye may find\n\nSolace when fortune proves unkind,\n\nAnd be newborn through many a kiss,\n\nThat he receives with inward bliss;\n\nWhen'er he clasps thee to his breast.\n\nMay he from all his toils find rest\n\nWhen he in thy dear arms shall sink,\n\nMay he new life and vigour drink:\n\nFresh joys of youth shalt thou obtain,\n\nIn merry jest rejoice again.\n\nWith raillery and roguish spite,\n\nThou now shalt tease him, now delight.\n\nThus Love will nevermore grow old,\n\nThus will the minstrel ne'er be cold!\"\nWhile he thus lives, in secret bless'd,\n\nAbove him in the clouds doth rest\n\nAn oak-wreath, verdant and sublime,\n\nPlaced on his brow in after-time;\n\nWhile they are banish'd to the slough,\n\nWho their great master disavow."}]}

She bent herself over, to draw out the water,\n\nHe the other pitcher took up, and bent himself over,\n\nAnd in the blue of the heavens they saw their figures reflected,\n\nWaving, and nodding, and in the mirror their greetings exchanging.\n\n\"Now let me drink,\" exclaim'd the youth in accents of gladness.\n\nAnd she gave him the pitcher. They then, like old friends, sat together,\n\nLeaning against the vessels, when she address'd him as follows\n\n\"Say, why find I you here without your carriage and horses,\n\nFar from the place where first I saw you. Pray how came you hither?\"\nHermann thoughtfully gazed on the ground, but presently lifted\n\nCalmly towards her his glances, and gazed on her face in kind fashion,\n\nFeeling quite calm and composed. And yet with love to address her\n\nFound he quite out of the question; for love from her eyes was not beaming,\n\nBut an intellect clear, which bade him use sensible language.\n\nSoon he collected his thoughts, and quietly said to the maiden:\u2014\n\n\"Let me speak, my child, and let me answer your questions.\n\n\"'Tis for your sake alone I have come,\u2014why seek to conceal it?\n\nFor I happily live with two affectionate parents,\n\nWhom I faithfully help to look after our house and possessions,\n\nBeing an only son, while numerous are our employments.\n\nI look after the field work; the house is carefully managed\n\nBy my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.\n\nBut you also have doubtless found out how greatly the servants,\n\nSometimes by fraud, and sometimes by levity, worry their mistress,\n\nConstantly making her change them, and barter one fault for another.\n\nLong has my mother, therefore, been wanting a girl in the household,\n\nWho, not only with hand, but also with heart might assist her,\n\nIn the place of the daughter she lost, alas, prematurely.\n\nNow when I saw you to-day near the carriage, so active and sprightly,\n\nSaw the strength of your arm and the perfect health of your members,\n\nWhen I heard your sensible words, I was struck with amazement,\n\nAnd I hasten'd back home, deservedly praising the stranger\n\nBoth to my parents and friends. And now I come to inform you\n\nWhat they desire, as I do. Forgive my stammering language!\"\n\"Do not hesitate,\" said she, \"to tell me the rest of your story\n\nI have with gratitude felt that you have not sought to insult me.\n\nSpeak on boldly, I pray; your words shall never alarm me;\n\nYou would fain hire me now as maid to your father and mother,\n\nTo look after the house, which now is in excellent order.\n\nAnd you think that in me you have found a qualified maiden,\n\nOne that is able to work, and not of a quarrelsome nature.\n\nYour proposal was short, and short shall my answer be also\n\nYes! with you I will go, and the voice of my destiny follow.\n\nI have fulfill'd my duty, and brought the lying-in woman\n\nBack to her friends again, who all rejoice at her rescue.\n\nMost of them now are together, the rest will presently join them.\n\nAll expect that they, in a few short days, will be able\n\nHomewards to go; 'tis thus that exiles themselves love to flatter.\n\nBut I cannot deceive myself with hopes so delusive\n\nIn these sad days which promise still sadder days in the future\n\nFor all the bonds of the world are loosen'd, and nought can rejoin them,\n\nSave that supreme necessity over our future impending.\n\nIf in the house of so worthy a man I can earn my own living,\n\nServing under the eye of his excellent wife, I will do so;\n\nFor a wandering girl bears not the best reputation.\n\nYes! with you I will go, as soon as I've taken the pitcher\n\nBack to my friends, and received the blessing of those worthy people.\n\nCome! you needs must see them, and from their hands shall receive me.\"\nJoyfully heard the youth the willing maiden's decision,\n\nDoubting whether he now had not better tell her the whole truth;\n\nBut it appear'd to him best to let her remain in her error,\n\nFirst to take her home, and then for her love to entreat her.\n\nAh! but now he espied a golden ring on her finger,\n\nAnd so let her speak, while he attentively listen'd:\u2014\n\"Let us now return,\" she continued, \"the custom is always\n\nTo admonish the maidens who tarry too long at the fountain,\n\nYet how delightful it is by the fast-flowing water to chatter!\"\n\nThen they both arose, and once more directed their glances\n\nInto the fountain, and then a blissful longing came o'er them.\nSo from the ground by the handles she silently lifted the pitchers,\n\nMounted the steps of the well, and Hermann follow'd the loved one.\n\nOne of the pitchers he ask'd her to give him, thus sharing the burden.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she said, \"the weight feels less when thus they are balanced;\n\nAnd the master I've soon to obey, should not be my servant.\n\nGaze not so earnestly at me, as if my fate were still doubtfull!\n\nWomen should learn betimes to serve, according to station,\n\nFor by serving alone she attains at last to the mast'ry,\n\nTo the due influence which she ought to possess in the household.\n\nEarly the sister must learn to serve her brothers and parents,\n\nAnd her life is ever a ceaseless going and coming,\n\nOr a lifting and carrying, working and doing for others.\n\nWell for her, if she finds no manner of life too offensive,\n\nAnd if to her the hours of night and of day all the same are,\n\nSo that her work never seems too mean, her needle too pointed,\n\nSo that herself she forgets, and liveth only for others!\n\nFor as a mother in truth she needs the whole of the virtues,\n\nWhen the suckling awakens the sick one, and nourishment calls for\n\nFrom the exhausted parent, heaping cares upon suff'ring.\n\nTwenty men together could not endure such a burden,\n\nAnd they ought not,\u2014and yet they gratefully ought to behold it.\"\nThus she spoke, and with her silent companion advanced she\n\nThrough the garden, until the floor of the granary reach'd they,\n\nWhere the sick woman lay, whom she left by her daughters attended,\n\nThose dear rescued maidens, the types of innocent beauty.\n\nBoth of them enter'd the room, and from the other direction,\n\nHolding a child in each hand, her friend, the magistrate, enter'd.\n\nThese had lately been lost for some time by the sorrowing mother,\n\nBut the old man had now found them out in the crowd of the people.\n\nAnd they sprang in with joy, to greet their dearly-loved mother,\n\nTo rejoice in a brother, the playmate now seen for the first time!\nThen on Dorothea they sprang, and greeted her warmly,\n\nAsking for bread and fruit, but asking for drink before all things.\n\nAnd they handed the water all round. The children first drank some,\n\nThen the sick woman drank, with her daughters, the magistrate also.\n\nAll were refresh'd, and sounded the praise of the excellent water;\n\nMineral was it, and very reviving, and wholesome for drinking.\nThen with a serious look continued the maiden, and spoke thus\n\nFriends, to your mouths for the last time in truth I have lifted the pitcher,\n\nAnd for the last time, alas, have moisten'd your lips with pure water.\n\nBut whenever in scorching heat your drink may refresh you,\n\nAnd in the shade you enjoy repose and a fountain unsullied,\n\nThen remember me, and all my friendly assistance,\n\nWhich I from love, and not from relationship merely have render'd.\n\nAll your kindness to me, as long as life lasts, I'll remember,\n\nI unwillingly leave you; but each one is now to each other\n\nRather a burden than comfort. We all must shortly be scatter'd\n\nOver a foreign land, unless to return we are able.\n\nSee, here stands the youth to whom for those gifts we're indebted,\n\nAll those clothes for the child, and all those acceptable viands.\n\nWell, he has come, and is anxious that I to his house should go with him,\n\nThere as a servant to act to his rich and excellent parents,\n\nAnd I have not refused him, for serving appears my vocation,\n\nAnd to be served by others at home would seem like a burden.\n\nSo I'll go willingly with him; the youth appears to be prudent,\n\nThus will his parents be properly cared for, as rich people should be.\n\nTherefore, now, farewell, my much-loved friend, and be joyful\n\nIn your living infant, who looks so healthily at you.\n\nWhen you press him against your bosom, wrapp'd up in those colourd\n\nSwaddling-clothes, then remember the youth who so kindly bestow'd them,\n\nAnd who in future will feed and clothe me also, your loved friend.\n\nYou too, excellent man,\" to the magistrate turning, she added\n\n\"Warmly I thank for so often acting the part of a father.\"\nThen she knelt herself down before the lying-in patient,\n\nKiss'd the weeping woman, her whisper'd blessing receiving.\n\nMeanwhile the worthy magistrate spoke to Hermann as follows\n\n\"You deserve, my friend to be counted amongst the good landlords\n\nWho are anxious to manage their house through qualified people.\n\nFor I have often observed how cautiously men are accustom'd\n\nSheep and cattle and horses to watch, when buying or bart'ring\n\nBut a man, who's so useful, provided he's good and efficient,\n\nAnd who does so much harm and mischief by treacherous dealings,\n\nHim will people admit to their houses by chance and haphazard,\n\nAnd too late find reason to rue an o'erhasty decision.\n\nThis you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosen\n\nAs your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.\n\nTreat her well, and as long as she finds the business suit her,\n\nYou will not miss your sister, your parents will miss not their daughter.\"\nOther persons now enter'd, the patient's nearest relations,\n\nMany articles bringing, and better lodgings announcing.\n\nAll were inform'd of the maiden's decision, and warmly bless'd Hermann,\n\nBoth with significant looks, and also with grateful expressions,\n\nAnd one secretly whispered into the ear of another\n\n\"If the master should turn to a bridegroom, her home is provided.\"\n\nHermann then presently took her hand, and address'd her as follows\n\n\"Let us be going; the day is declining, and far off the village.\"\n\nThen the women, with lively expressions, embraced Dorothea;\n\nHermann drew her away; they still continued to greet her.\n\nNext the children, with screams and terrible crying attack'd her,\n\nPulling her clothes, their second mother refusing to part from.\n\nBut first one of the women, and then another rebuked them\n\n\"Children, hush! to the town she is going, intending to bring you\n\nPlenty of gingerbread back, which your brother already had order'd,\n\nFrom the confectioner, when the stork was passing there lately,\n\nAnd she'll soon return, with papers prettily gilded.\"\nSo at length the children released her; but scarcely could Hermann\n\nTear her from their embraces and distant-signalling kerchiefs."}]}

My Hermann shall not be upbraided,\n\nFor I know that he well deserves the wealth he'll inherit;\n\nHe'll be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and peasants,\n\nAnd, as I clearly foresee, by no means the last in the Council.\n\nBut with your blame and reproaches, you daily dishearten him sadly,\n\nAs you have done just now, and make the poor fellow unhappy.\"\nThen she left the apartment, and after her son hasten'd quickly,\n\nHoping somewhere to find him, and with her words of affection\n\nGladden his heart, for he, the excellent son, well deserved it.\n\nSmilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father\n\n\"What a wonderful race of people are women and children.\n\nAll of them fain would do whatever pleases their fancy,\n\nAnd we're only alow'd to praise them and flatter them freely.\n\nOnce for all there's truth in the ancient proverb which tells us:\n\nHe who moves not forward, goes backward! a capital saying!\"\nSpeaking with much circumspection, the druggist made answer as follows\n\n\"What you say, good neighbour, is certainly true, and my plan is\n\nAlways to think of improvement, provided tho' new, 'tis not costly.\n\nBut what avails it in truth, unless one has plenty of money,\n\nActive and fussy to he, improving both inside and outside?\n\nSadly confined are the means of a burgher; e'en when he knows it,\n\nLittle that's good he is able to do, his purse is too narrow,\n\nAnd the sum wanted too great; and so he is always prevented.\n\nI have had plenty of schemes! but then I was terribly frighten'd\n\nAt the expense, especially during a time of such danger.\n\nLong had my house smiled upon me, decked out in modish exterior,\n\nLong had my windows with large panes of glass resplendently glitterd.\n\nWho can compete with a merchant, however, who, rolling in riches,\n\nAlso knows the manner in which what is best can be purchased?\n\nOnly look at the house up yonder, the new one: how handsome\n\nLooks the stucco of those white scrolls on the green-colour'd panels!\n\nLarge are the plates of the windows\u2014how shining and brilliant the panes are,\n\nQuite eclipsing the rest of the houses that stand in the market!\n\nYet at the time of the fire, our two were by far the most handsome,\n\nMine at the sign of the Angel, and yours at the old Golden Lion.\n\nThen my garden was famous throughout the whole country, and strangers\n\nUsed to stop as they pass'd and peep through my red-colourd palings\n\nAt my beggars of stone, and at my dwarfs, which were painted,\n\nHe to whom I gave coffee inside my beautiful grotto,\n\nWhich, alas! is now cover'd with dust and tumbling to pieces,\n\nUsed to rejoice in the colour'd glimmering light of the mussels,\n\nRanged in natural order around it, and connoisseurs even\n\nUsed with dazzled eyes to gaze at the spars and the coral.\n\nThen, in the drawing-room, people look'd with delight on the painting,\n\nWhere the prim ladies and gentlemen walked in the garden demurely,\n\nAnd with pointed fingers presented the flowers, and held them.\n\nAh, if only such things were now to be seen! Little care I\n\nNow to go out; for everything needs to be alter'd and tasteful,\n\nAs it is call'd; and white are the benches of wood and the palings;\n\nAll things are simple and plain; and neither carving not gilding\n\nNow are employ'd, and foreign timber is now all the fashion.\n\nI should be only too pleased to possess some novelty also,\n\nSo as to march with the times, and my household furniture alter.\n\nBut we all are afraid to make the least alteration,\n\nFor who is able to pay the present charges of workmen?\n\nLately a fancy possess'd me, the angel Michael, whose figure\n\nHangs up over my shop, to treat to a new coat of gilding,\n\nAnd the terrible Dragon, who round his feet is entwining;\n\nBut I have left him all brown; as he is; for the cost quite alarm'd me."}]}

POLYHYMNIA.\nTHE COSMOPOLITE.\nBUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,\n\nWith the landlord, the worthy divine, and also the druggist,\n\nAnd the conversation still concern'd the same subject,\n\nWhich in every form they had long been discussing together.\n\nFull of noble thoughts, the excellent pastor continued\n\n\"I can't contradict you. I know 'tis the duty of mortals\n\nEver to strive for improvement; and, as we may see, they strive also\n\nEver for that which is higher, at least what is new they seek after,\n\nBut don't hurry too fast! For combined with these feelings, kind Nature\n\nAlso has given us pleasure in dwelling on that which is ancient,\n\nAnd in clinging to that to which we have long been accustom'd.\n\nEach situation is good that's accordant to nature and reason.\n\nMany things man desires, and yet he has need of but little;\n\nFor but short are the days, and confined is the lot of a mortal.\n\nI can never blame the man who, active and restless,\n\nHurries along, and explores each corner of earth and the ocean\n\nBoldly and carefully, while he rejoices at seeing the profits\n\nWhich round him and his family gather themselves in abundance.\n\nBut I also duly esteem the peaceable burgher,\n\nWho with silent steps his paternal inheritance paces,\n\nAnd watches over the earth, the seasons carefully noting.\n\n'Tis not every year that he finds his property alter'd;\n\nNewly-planted trees cannot stretch out their arms tow'rds the heavens\n\nAll in a moment, adorn'd with beautiful buds in abundance.\n\nNo, a man has need of patience, he also has need of\n\nPure unruffled tranquil thoughts and an intellect honest;\n\nFor to the nourishing earth few seeds at a time he entrusteth,\n\nFew are the creatures he keeps at a time, with a view to their breeding,\n\nFor what is Useful alone remains the first thought of his lifetime.\n\nHappy the man to whom Nature a mind thus attuned may have given!\n\n'Tis by him that we all are fed. And happy the townsman\n\nOf the small town who unites the vocations of town and of country.\n\nHe is exempt from the pressure by which the poor farmer is worried,\n\nIs not perplex'd by the citizens' cares and soaring ambition,\n\nWho, with limited means,\u2014especially women and maidens,\u2014\n\nThink of nothing but aping the ways of the great and the wealthy,\n\nYou should therefore bless your son's disposition so peaceful,\n\nAnd the like-minded wife whom we soon may expect him to marry.\nThus he spoke. At that moment the mother and son stood before them.\n\nBy the hand she led him and placed him in front of her husband\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"how often have we, when talking together,\n\nThought of that joyful day in the future, when Hermann, selecting\n\nAfter long waiting his bride at length would make us both happy!\n\nAll kinds of projects we form'd. designing first one, then another\n\nGirl as his wife, as we talk'd in the manner that parents delight in.\n\nNow the day has arrived; and now has his bride been conducted\n\nHither and shown him by Heaven; his heart at length has decided.\n\nWere we not always saying that he should choose for himself, and\n\nWere you not lately wishing that he might feel for a maiden\n\nWarm and heart-felt emotions? And now has arrived the right moment!\n\nYes, he has felt and has chosen, and like a man has decided.\n\nThat fair maiden it is, the Stranger whom he encounter'd.\n\nGive her him; else he'll remain\u2014he has sworn it\u2014unmarried for ever.\"\nAnd the son added himself:\u2014\"My father, O give her! My heart has\n\nChosen purely and truly: she'll make you an excellent daughter.\"\nBut the father was silent. Then suddenly rose the good pastor,\n\nAnd address'd him as follows:\u2014\" One single moment's decisive\n\nBoth of the life of a man, and of the whole of his Future.\n\nAfter lengthen'd reflection, each resolution made by him\n\nIs but the work of a moment; the prudent alone seize the right one.\n\nNothing more dangerous is, in making a choice, than revolving\n\nFirst this point and then that, and so confusing the feelings.\n\nPure is Hermann's mind; from his youth I have known him; he never,\n\nEven in boyhood, was wont to extend his hand hither and thither.\n\nWhat he desired, was suitable to him; he held to it firmly.\n\nBe not astonish'd and scared, because there appears on a sudden\n\nWhat you so long have desired. 'Tis true the appearance at present\n\nBears not the shape of the wish, as you in your mind had conceived it.\n\nFor our wishes conceal the thing that we wish for; our gifts too\n\nCome from above upon us, each clad in its own proper figure.\n\nDo not now mistake the maiden who has succeeded\n\nFirst in touching the heart of your good wise son, whom you love so.\n\nHappy is he who is able to clasp the hand of his first love,\n\nAnd whose dearest wish is not doom'd to pine in his bosom!\n\nYes, I can see by his face, already his fate is decided;\n\nTrue affection converts the youth to a man in a moment.\n\nHe little changeable is; I fear me, if this you deny him,\n\nAll the fairest years of his life will be changed into sorrow.\"\nThen in prudent fashion the druggist, who long had been wanting\n\nHis opinion to give, rejoin'd in the following manner\n\n\"This is Just a case when the middle course is the wisest!\n\n'Hasten slowly,' you know, was the motto of Caesar Augustus.\n\nI am always ready to be of use to my neighbours,\n\nAnd to turn to their profit what little wits I can boast of.\n\nYouth especially needs the guidance of those who are older.\n\nLet me then depart; I fain would prove her, that maiden,\n\nAnd will examine the people 'mongst whom she lives, and who know her.\n\nI am not soon deceived; I know how to rate their opinions.\"\nThen forthwith replied the son, with eagerness speaking:\u2014\n\n\"Do so, neighbour, and go, make your inquiries. However,\n\nI should greatly prefer that our friend, the pastor, went with you;\n\nTwo such excellent men are witnesses none can find fault with.\n\nO, my father! the maiden no vagabond is, I assure you,\n\nNo mere adventurer, wand'ring about all over the country,\n\nAnd deceiving the inexperienced youths with her cunning;\n\nNo! the harsh destiny link'd with this war, so destructive of all things,\n\nWhich is destroying the world, and already has wholly uprooted\n\nMany a time-honour'd fabric, has driven the poor thing to exile.\n\nAre not brave men of noble birth now wand'ring in mis'ry?\n\nPrinces are fleeing disguised, and monarchs in banishment living.\n\nAh, and she also herself, the best of her sisters, is driven\n\nOut of her native land; but her own misfortunes forgetting,\n\nOthers she seeks to console, and, though helpless, is also most helpful.\n\nGreat are the woes and distress which over the earth's face are brooding,\n\nBut may happiness not be evoked from out of this sorrow?\n\nMay not I, in the arms of my bride, the wife I have chosen,\n\nEven rejoice at the war, as you at the great conflagration?\"\nThen replied the father, and open'd his mouth with importance:\u2014\n\n\"Strangely indeed, my son, has your tongue been suddenly loosen'd,\n\nWhich for years has stuck in your mouth, and moved there but rarely\n\nI to-day must experience that which threatens each father:\n\nHow the ardent will of a son a too-gentle mother\n\nWillingly favours, whilst each neighbour is ready to back him,\n\nOnly provided it be at the cost of a father or husband!\n\nBut what use would it be to resist so many together?\n\nFor I see that defiance and tears will otherwise greet me.\n\nGo and prove her, and in God's name then hasten to bring her\n\nHome as my daughter; if not, he must think no more of the maiden.\"\nThus spake the father. The son exclaim'd with jubilant gesture\n\n\"Ere the ev'ning arrives, you shall have the dearest of daughters,\n\nSuch as the man desires whose bosom is govern'd by prudence\n\nAnd I venture to think the good creature is fortunate also.\n\nYes, she will ever be grateful that I her father and mother\n\nHave restored her in you, as sensible children would wish it.\n\nBut I will loiter no longer; I'll straightway harness the horses,\n\nAnd conduct our friends on the traces of her whom I love so,\n\nLeave the men to themselves and their own intuitive wisdom,\n\nAnd be guided alone by their decision\u2014I swear it,\u2014\n\nAnd not see the maiden again, until she my own is.\"\n\nThen he left the house; meanwhile the others were eagerly\n\nSettling many a point, and the weighty matter debating.\nHermann sped to the stable forthwith, where the spirited stallions\n\nTranquilly stood and with eagerness swallow'd the pure oats before them,\n\nAnd the well-dried hay, which was cut from the best of their meadows.\n\nThen in eager haste in their mouths the shining bits placed he,\n\nQuickly drew the harness through the well-plated buckles,\n\nAnd then fastend the long broad reins in proper position,\n\nLed the horses out in the yard, where already the carriage,\n\nEasily moved along by its pole, had been push'd by the servant.\n\nThen they restrain'd the impetuous strength of the fast-moving horses,\n\nFastening both with neat-looking ropes to the bar of the carriage.\n\nHermann seized his whip, took his seat, and drove to the gateway.\n\nWhen in the roomy carriage his friends had taken their places,\n\nSwiftly he drove away, and left the pavement behind them,\n\nLeft behind the walls of the town and the clean-looking towers,\n\nThus sped Hermann along, till he reach'd the familiar highway,\n\nNot delaying a moment, and galloping uphill and downhill.\n\nWhen however at length the village steeple descried he,\n\nAnd not far away lay the houses surrounded by gardens,\n\nHe began to think it was time to hold in the horses.\nBy the time-honour'd gloom of noble lime-trees o'er shadow'd,\n\nWhich for many a century past on the spot had been rooted,\n\nStood there a green and spreading grass-plot in front of the village,\n\nCover'd with turf, for the peasants and neighbouring townsmen a playground.\n\nScooped out under the trees, to no great depth, stood a fountain.\n\nOn descending the steps, some benches of stone might be seen there,\n\nRanged all around the spring, which ceaselessly well'd forth its waters,\n\nCleanly, enclosed by a low wall all round, and convenient to draw from.\n\nHermann then determined beneath the shadow his horses\n\nWith the carriage to stop. He did so, and spoke then as follows\n\n\"Now, my friends, get down, and go by yourselves to discover\n\nWhether the maiden is worthy to have the hand which I offer.\n\nI am convinced that she is; and you'll bring me no new or strange story:\n\nHad I to manage alone, I would straightway go off to the village,\n\nAnd in few words should my fate by the charming creature be settled.\nHer you will easily recognize 'mongst all the rest of the people,\n\nFor her appearance is altogether unlike that of others.\n\nBut I will now describe the modest dress she is wearing:\u2014\n\nFirst a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,\n\nPrettily tied, while black are the stays fitting closely around her.\n\nThen the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,\n\nWhich with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling.\n\nFree and joyously rises her head with its elegant oval,\n\nStrongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted\n\nHer blue well-plaited gown begins from under her bodice.\n\nAnd as she walks envelopes her well-turn'd ankles completely.\n\nBut I have one thing to say, and this must expressly entreat you:\n\nDo not speak to the maiden, and let not your scheme be discover'd.\n\nBut inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you,\n\nWhen you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother,\n\nThen return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.\n\nThis is the plan which I have matured, while driving you hither.\"\nThus he spoke, and the friends forthwith went on to the village,\n\nWhere, in gardens and barns and houses, the multitude crowded;\n\nAll along the broad road the numberless carts were collected,\n\nMen were feeding the lowing cattle and feeding the horses.\n\nWomen on every hedge the linen were carefully drying,\n\nWhilst the children in glee were splashing about in the streamlet.\n\nForcing their way through the waggons, and past the men and the cattle,\n\nWalk'd the ambassador spies, looking well to the righthand and lefthand,\n\nHoping somewhere to see the form of the well-described maiden;\n\nBut wherever they look'd, no trace of the girl they discover'd.\nPresently denser became the crowd. Round some of the waggons.\n\nMen in a passion were quarrelling, women also were screaming.\n\nThen of a sudden approach'd an aged man with firm footstep\n\nMarching straight up to the fighters; and forthwith was hush'd the contention,\n\nWhen he bade them be still, and with fatherly earnestness threaten'd.\n\n\"Are we not yet,\" he exclaim'd, \"by misfortune so knitted together,\n\nAs to have learnt at length the art of reciprocal patience\n\nAnd toleration, though each cannot measure the actions of others?\n\nProsperous men indeed may quarrel! Will sorrow not teach you\n\nHow no longer as formerly you should quarrel with brethren?\n\nEach should give way to each other, when treading the soil of the stranger,\n\nAnd, as you hope for mercy yourselves, you should share your possessions.\"\nThus the man address'd them, and all were silent. In peaceful\n\nHumour the reconciled men look'd after their cattle and waggons.\n\nWhen the pastor heard the man discourse in this fashion,\n\nAnd the foreign magistrate's peaceful nature discovered,\n\nHe approach'd him in turn, and used this significant language\n\n\"Truly, Father, when nations are living in days of good fortune,\n\nDrawing their food from the earth, which gladly opens its treasures,\n\nAnd its wish'd-for gifts each year and each month is renewing,\n\nThen all matters go smoothly; each thinks himself far the wisest,\n\nAnd the best, and so they exist by the side of each other,\n\nAnd the most sensible man no better than others is reckon'd\n\nFor the world moves on, as if by itself and in silence.\n\nBut when distress unsettles our usual manner of living,\n\nPulls down each time-honour'd fabric, and roots up the seed in our gardens,\n\nDrives the man and his wife far away from the home they delight in,\n\nHurries them off in confusion through days and nights full of anguish,\n\nAh! then look we around in search of the man who is wisest,\n\nAnd no longer in vain he utters his words full of wisdom.\n\nTell me whether you be these fugitives' magistrate, Father,\n\nOver whose minds you appear to possess such an influence soothing?\n\nAye, to-day I could deem you one of the leaders of old time,\n\nWho through wastes and through deserts conducted the wandering people;\n\nI could imagine 'twas Joshua I am addressing, or Moses.\"\nThen with solemn looks the magistrate answer'd as follows\n\n\"Truly the present times resemble the strangest of old times,\n\nWhich are preserved in the pages of history, sacred or common.\n\nHe in these days who has lived to-day and yesterday only,\n\nMany a year has lived, events so crowd on each other.\n\nWhen I reflect back a little, a grey old age I could fancy\n\nOn my head to be lying, and yet my strength is still active.\n\nYes, we people in truth may liken ourselves to those others\n\nUnto whom in a fiery bush appear'd, in a solemn\n\nMoment, the Lord our God; in fire and clouds we behold him.\"\nWhen the pastor would fain continue to speak on this subject,\n\nAnd was anxious to learn the fate of the man and his party,\n\nQuickly into his ear his companion secretly whisper'd\n\n\"Speak for a time with the magistrate, turning your talk on the maiden,\n\nWhilst I wander about, endeav'ring to find her. Directly\n\nI am successful, I'll join you again.\" Then nodded the pastor,\n\nAnd the spy went to seek her, in barns and through hedges and gardens."}]}
