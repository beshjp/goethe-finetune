Some amusing nonsense from the model:

>    "*You say: the world is vain. But if it is, there's this good thing about it, that I repeat anew every day: it was made for men, even for such an unimportant fellow. So I'll do my bit in my corner, in my costume, with my particular property to the day of Judgment and the terror of all ghostly appearances, and the original appearance in which the Lord God will recognise me. Yes, dear friend, we can't get much rumination like that out of him. One of the king's intimates, a certain courtier, said to him one day: 'Y'all mun rread all the noovvvelsâ€”I moost!' and the king laughed, as I laugh, and as every one out of Hamlet's inner circle of friends must and will laugh; for every one is Hamlet, and understands him too. All this is no representation of sense, but of the burden of the nerve-life, in those things which are inclined to rush by in a moment; for every moment is past before you can think of it, and before a man quite knows how to treat it.
